# Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is open source tool for building development environments. We assume that you have followed the first instructions on README.md to install Vagrant and VirtualBox on your OS. Below you will find a shortened version on how to install this software quickly if needed as a reference. 

### Ubuntu
```
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox
    sudo apt-get install vagrant
```
### OSX
Open your `Terminal`. We assume that [brew](http://brew.sh/) is already installed.
```
    brew install vagrant
    brew cask install virtualbox
```
### Windows
You need to manually install git, virtualbox, and vagrant via internet from the installation links provided above. Afterwards, open your `Command Prompt` to check that the following are up and running properly:
```
vagrant --version
vboxmanage --version 
```
To run the vboxmanage --version command from your command prompt you can run the command by going into the directory where the executable is located or you can add virtualbox to path environment variables by doing the following steps :

1.Right click on Computer.

2.Click on Properties

3.Click on Advanced System Settings which opens up a pop up box 

4.Click on Environment Variables

5.Click Edit User variables

6. Click new then browse the directory where your the executable is located and click ok

After installing a communityBeLL on your OS, you will need to follow these instructions to use your communityBeLL. Vagrant only works when you have installed vagrant and you are in the proper directory where your vagrant file is located. To find the proper directory, open your `Terminal` or `Command Prompt` and type `cd ole--vagrant-bells/release` in order to be in the right directory. 
Now that you are in the right directory, check the status of vagrant with `vagrant global-status`. You should have the following message:

```
id       name   provider   state   directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2198a3d  ole    virtualbox running /Users/Emily/ole--vagrant-bells/release

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```
If you have a different message, your vagrant is powered off, you have multiple machines of the same name, or you have another technical issue.

If your vagrant is powered off, use `vagrant up` to turn it on. To shut down your machine, use `vagrant halt`. These two commands require that you are in the right directory. To destroy your machine entirely, use `vagrant destroy`. Remember, by using `vagrant destroy`, you destroy the machine and will need to rebuild a communityBeLL if you wish to use it. It requires that you enter your password and this is not undoable. 

We suggest doing some light googling to tell you more about the background and commands of vagrant. Use `vagrant --help` for other commands that you may need. See `vagrant --help` below:

```
Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]

    -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.
