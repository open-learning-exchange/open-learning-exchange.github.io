What do these 3 tools mean ? Git, Virtual Box and Vagrant?

Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system that is widely used for software development and other version control tasks. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Virtual machine manager is like virtualbox. VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization application. What does that mean? For one thing, it installs on your existing Intel or AMD-based computers, whether they are running Windows, Mac, Linux or Solaris operating systems. Secondly, it extends the capabilities of your existing computer so that it can run multiple operating systems (inside multiple virtual machines) at the same time.
