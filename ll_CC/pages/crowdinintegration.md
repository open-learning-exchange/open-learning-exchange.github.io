# Crowdin Integration
----------
Our first process on Crowdin is to provide screenshots and context for the strings. This can be done in the steps below. The long-term goal is to integrate our code with Crowdin so that there are live screens of the BeLL to help translators. We also want to simplify the process between our Crowdin and GitHub. Right now, we manually copy the texts into GitHub from Crowdin string by string, which as you can imagine, is time-consuming and inefficient as it cannot be switched easily from the downloadable csv format to a json for our git code. 

 1. Go to main project page of the Open Learning Exchange Crowdin Project and click on Settings. It should lead you to the page show below. Now navigate to Screenshots.

 3. Once you’re there, you can begin adding screenshots of the BeLL interface. The screenshots should be of various pages in the BeLL interface. Once you have uploaded a screenshot, it should appear on the top left slot of the uploaded screenshots. 
 4. Select the screenshot and then select drag and drop.

 5. This will open up a side navigation bar as shown below.

 6. Click the text recognition tool at the top-left to highlight all relevant text on the image.

 7. Use it to highlight the text you want to tag. Once the text is highlighted, double check to make sure that the tag matches the text on the page and if not, click as shown below.

 8. This will open up an editor as shown below. Now you can edit in the editor to make sure that the tag matches the text on the page.

 9. Once you have tagged on the strings, click save. Reopen the screenshot you just tagged (you will need this for reference). Open the main project page in a new tab. You will now need to check what your strings are linked to the right context in the translation interface. The following steps detail how to do this.

 10.  Select a language. Any language will do since we’re searching in English.

 11.  Selecting a language will bring you to this page. Click on OLE OpenBeLL Interface.

 12. Now you can search up the a string that you tagged in the screenshot, and verify that your screenshot is visible in the main interface for each of the terms you tagged. You can either scroll through the terms using the scroll bars on the left or use the arrows below the “Enter translation here” box. For each of the strings you selected on your screenshot, verify that the screenshot is correct. Use the “Edit Context” to add a more detailed description of the string.
