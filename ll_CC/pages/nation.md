##Nation BeLLs

On the community side of the BeLL, there must be a process of syncing your local community BeLL on your OS. Emily will be completeing that process for you currently, but it is important for you to understand it conceptually. First, I signed in as an administrator (admin/password). Then, I clicked on the "Manager" button next to my name that allows me to access administrative material. Once there, I have the option of selecting "Communities" and then manually adding community configurations using the correct and matching information from all of your communities. I have done this step for you with the screenshots you sent in the Gitter chat.

There should to be constant communication between the nation and the communities. While is not necessary for remote communities in the field, it is ideal for our goals of improving the software and testing the increasing forms of communication and feedback between the nation and the communities. This communication takes the form of a syncing process from the community side where you select material to send to the nation. In this tutorial, we will be focusing on the community side almost exclusively as we will be introducing the nation side later on. 

As you can see from the picture below, login using admin/password and click on "Manager".

Next, click on "Sync with Nation".

Then, "Select All" and click "Send".

You have now send all activities on your community to the nation. To explain further, the nation receives a number of data points: number of resources opened, number of logins, number of members, resource ratings, techincal feedback, and resource requests. We don't get specific information on individual users, but rather usage and feedback as whole. 

On the nation side, you can log in as admin/password and check that the sync worked. Click on "Manager" once again.

Then, click on "Communities" to acces reports from various communities on the nation.

Then, you should see a list of communities and the option to generate a report if you so wished.

This is the usual sync process from the community side. There are three other important kinds of updates that you receive on the community side: updates, publications, and surveys.  

As you can see from the image below, there is an update, a publication, and a survey ready for download. 

![Update, Publication, and Survey ready from the nation](/ll_CC/pages/uploads/images/nation.md7.png)

First, click the "Update Available" button and it will reload your homepage witha successful update message. An update refers to a new software update which improves the software. Next, click on "Publications" and sync the publication. Publications add new resources or courses to your library. 

Last, click on the "Surveys" button and select to "Download" the survey. After this, your community will have new software, resources, and a survey to take. You can only add these as an administrator: a normal learner would not be able to do this. Please complete the survey and open the resource from the publication and then repeat the process of sending an activities sync to the nation.
