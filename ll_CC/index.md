#Welcome! 

This is a MD Wiki for our Virtual Interns program. Please feel free to explore and offer suggestions on our [gitter.im chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat). 

Our Virtual Interns program is part of the software development strategy by [Open Learning Exchange](http://www.ole.org/) (OLÉ). We are a non-profit and for-purpose organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We strive to provide universal quality education using open source materials and technology to address educational barriers. 

##Assignments
###Assignment #3
Due 5/20/16
1. Complete the tutorial under the [GitHub Issues tab](pages/githubissues.md) and be sure to keep us posted in the Gitter chat.
2. Please post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as personal practice. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. Following, do and create pull requests. Don't forget you can also comment and work on issues that you didn't create.
3. Spend this time getting comfortable with GitHub. The more you work and commit and push, the better your GitHub profile is. This is very important to potential employers so we encourage you to spend time to increase your numbers so that your profile is strengthened.
4. Follow Open Learning Exchange, Emily, and Dogi on GitHub. Please also follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.

###Assignment #2
Due 5/11/16
1. Follow the instructions on the [GitHub and Markdown page](pages/githubandmarkdown.md) and comment on the [gitter.im chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat) when you have completed these steps.
2. Review [Vagrant instructions](pages/vagrant.md) to ensure that you have completed last week's assignment fully. 
3. Follow the instructions under the BeLL-Apps tab. 

###Assignment #1
Due 5/4/16
1. Go to [this GitHub address](https://github.com/dogi/ole--vagrant-bells) to read through the basic instructions on how to create your own digital library (what we call the BeLL, or Basic e-Learning Library). It involves several steps of downloading various content to your OS so that you can use and work within our software. You should be able to scroll down to see ole--vagrant-bells, but you can also find it in the README.md file. Please do not make ANY changes to the text or files: simply read and follow the directions.
2. Please send Emily your resume again (along with a short description of yourself and what you would like to be called) to emily@ole.org. 
3. We use Crowdin to translate our user interface in many different languages. Please go to [this Crowdin link](https://crowdin.com/project/open-learning-exchange/invite) to join Crowdin by creating an account. If you speak an additional language, it would be very helpful for you to translate some of the words and familiarize yourself with the software. We will be using it later on in the summer.
