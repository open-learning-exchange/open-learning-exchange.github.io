#Welcome! 

This is a MDwiki for our Virtual Interns program. Please feel free to explore and offer suggestions on our [gitter.im chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat).

Our Virtual Interns program is part of the software development strategy by [Open Learning Exchange](http://www.ole.org/) (OLE). We are a non-profit and for-purpose organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We strive to provide universal quality education using open source materials and technology to address educational barriers.

More specifically, we are currently working on a Basic E-Learning Library (BeLL). To learn more about how it works, check out the [Planet User Manual](http://open-learning-exchange.github.io/#!pages/planetusermanual.md).
