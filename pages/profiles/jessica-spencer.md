## About Me

I am a recent graduate with a degree in CS and American Studies: Politics, Policy and Society from Connecticut College. I use technology to contribute to the community, be it through research, education or social impact. I've previously done work in `java, python, and full stack development.` Here are some examples of the work that I've done during previous internships / out-of-school projects:


Where? |When? | Languages and Technologies Used | Project / Research
---|---|---|---
UN Hack for Humanity | Summer 2016 | IBM Bluemix | Proposed a machine learning application to spot accounts on social media of young at-risk individuals and provide a platform for appropriate intervention
BAE Systems|Summer 2016 |Java | Built machine-learning classification software for images using Java’s OpenCV and Maven, saving user’s time from hand training image sets. Optimized a relational search engine by appropriately filtering out widespread and ordinary terms using natural language processing
WRS Health|Summer 2015 | Full Stack, but mostly PHP | Increased sales of discounted medications by implementing a confidential and secure system of receiving relevant medication coupons through the patient web portal and a secure, personalized email

Recently I've also been into learning about:

* computer security 
* civic technology 
* finding air-conditioned cafes

Looking forward to joining the project! Wiggle the cursor after you redirect to this [link](https://www.staggeringbeauty.com/) to understand how I feel.
