I am a recent graduate with a degree in CS and American Studies: Politics, Policy and Society from Connecticut College. 
I use technology to contribute to the community, be it through research, education or social impact. 
Recently I've also been into learning about 
* computer security 
* civic technology 
* finding air-conditioned cafes
