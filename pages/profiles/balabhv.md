Virinchi Balabhadrapatruni

Westford, Massachsetts / EST

My name is Virinchi Balabhadrapatruni. I am 22 years old, and I am a graduate of UMass Lowell with Bachelor's Degrees in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as well as a minor in Mathematics. My primary interest is front-end softwar development, be it web or mobile frontend development. 

I am comfortable with Windows XP and up, Mac OS X Maverick and up, Ubuntu, and Debian. I have also worked with Raspbian as part of my Electrial Engineering Capstone Project.

I am a proud Eagle Scout. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar and drums.
