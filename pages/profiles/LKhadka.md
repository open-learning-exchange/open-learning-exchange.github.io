Hi, everyone! I am a sophomore at University of Louisiana at Monroe majoring in Computer Science.

I am interested in programming especially web development. I have learned a few languages for it such as  

### HTML
```html
<h1>Hello World in HTML!</h1>
```

### CSS
```css
body::after {
  content: 'Hello World in CSS!'
}
```

### Javascript
```javascript 
let msg = `
           Hello World in Javascript!
           (See the output in your developer tools!)
           `;
console.log(msg);
```

### React
```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello World in React!</h1>,
  document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]
);
``` 

I started my journey to learn web development through [_freeCodeCamp's_ challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and you can find my profile [**here**](https://www.freecodecamp.com/lkhadka).
 
I am looking forward to work with everyone at OLE!
