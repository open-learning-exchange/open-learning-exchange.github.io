Hi, everyone! I am a sophomore at University of Louisiana at Monroe majoring in Computer Science.

I am interested in programming especially web development. I have learned a few languages for it such as:
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * React
 
I started my journey to learn web development through [_freeCodeCamp's_ challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and you can find my profile [**here**](https://www.freecodecamp.com/lkhadka).
 
I am looking forward to work with everyone at OLE and here's a picture of me at [HackUTD](http://hackutd.co/).
