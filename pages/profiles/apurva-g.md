### Brief Introduction:

I am a graduate student at Boston University, studying Master of Science in Computer Science.

completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering. I believe myself as a quick learner.
I spend my free time playing badminton, biking and reading fictional books. I like to be called as Apurva.
