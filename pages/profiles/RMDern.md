# About Me

I'm Ryan, a Computer Science student and Game Developer. I attended a technical high school for IT before graduating and becoming a Game Programming major at Champlain College in Burlington, VT. I have since returned home to the Boston area where I'm working to establish a strong portfolio and continuing to pursue my future in Software Engineering.

In my free time, you might find me rock climbing, hiking, playing darts, or volunteering.
