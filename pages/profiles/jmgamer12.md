## Introduction:
Hello all! I am a sophomore in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am a quirky individual who
enjoys the likes of [_**Rick and Morty**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty) and [_**NBA 2K16**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_2K16). I've been known to buy interesting clothing pieces and I am always available
