I am a graduate Computer Science student at New York University. I am always excited to learn new things and my interests are programming and Big Data analysis. Some of the languages/frameworks I have experience in are:

|Languages|Platforms|
|:---|:---|
|Java|Hadoop|
|Python|Spark|
|SQL|Amazon AWS|
|C++|Unix|
|JavaScript|Docker|

I like watching __new__ movies and playing sports. My favorite sports are Cricket, Basketball and Badminton. I have no "favorite" movie. I enjoy watching different kinds of movies and I do not like to watch a movie again.

>Fun fact- The mysterious city in the acclaimed animated movie *Spirited Away* really exists. Here's a picture sent by my friend who visited:
