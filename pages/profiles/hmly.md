**Summary**

I am a recent graduate with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I enjoy programming and learning new technologies in my spare time, and I will be overjoyed if I have the opportunity to work on more challenging projects. I started learning programming in my high school years with Java being my first language and in college years I worked as a research assistant on two separate projects; the first one involved numemric and text data analysis, while in the second one I was tasked with developing a website. Here are some programming languages I have experience in:

* Java
  * Maven, Spring, Android
* Python
  * NLTK, Numpy, Pandas (Data Science)
* C
* Erlang
* PHP
* HTML & CSS
  * Twitter Bootstrap
* JavaScript
  * JQuery

Here are what I am currently learning:
  1. Ruby on Rails
  2. Java Hibernate
  
And finally here are my projects as a research assistant:

| Year | Project | Description |
| -----|:-------:|:-----------|
| 2015 | Automated Extraction of Product Attributes | Attributed words included ones pertaining to colors, etc. |
| 2017 | Finite Math Website | Include various learning resources |
  
 As for my other hobbies, I really enjoy *gaming* especially mobile games and *arts*. Here is an image of Boston.
