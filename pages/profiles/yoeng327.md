###### Let me introduce briefly about myself:
I am senior Computer Science major student at a University of Maryland. Since I realized that programming creates the efficient goods from nothing, I have been eager to join in some real-world applications teams during college years. My strongest skill is Java, C, JavaScript. I think that this internship opportunity will be a good opportunity to learn development in a collaborative team.
