I'm from Boston, MA so based in the EST time zone of course. I am currently a sophomore at UMass Lowell, majoring in Computer Science.
So far my courses have been primarily taught in C, but next semester we are taking the step up to C++, so I'm naturally quite excited
for that experience. I've had experience in a few languages, but given the extent of my coursework, I am by far most adept at C, 
but am always excited to learn more! I've done some minor web development work, but nothing to the extent of the work at OLE,
so I'm really looking forward to the opportunity of learning and working on a project of this scale. 

#### Outside of Coding, some of my other Hobbies include: ####
* Basketball (_Huge Celtics fan, and love playing as well_)
* Soccer
* I used to play a ton of Video Games, but quit them in the name of productivity. Instead I discovered internet Chess and fell in love with that :/
* Now instead of playing Video Games, I watch them, with CS:GO and Dota 2 being the primary examples (*Huge EG and Cloud9 supporter*)
* When I'm at school I enjoy going out with friends, and having a good time
* Lastly, I've been building desktops since I was 12, and am looking forward to building a new machine this summer (*Ryzen's got me really hyped...*)

I primarily use Mac OS X (*10.12.4 currently*) for coding, but I have an Ubuntu (_16.04_) partition on my laptop as well, and a Windows desktop at home.
