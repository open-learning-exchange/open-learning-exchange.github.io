>> Hey everyone, my name is Steven Mem and I am a senior undergrad in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology.
I am currently enrolled at the New York Institute of Technology in Manhattan. Hopefully everyone here is looking forward to start working
on new projects because I am. Nice to meet you all.
