__Description about me:__
I'm an enthusastic teenager that is self taught in a couple of languages. 
In my free time, I row for my high school rowing program, and I love to workout. 
Currently, I attend Boston College High School, and Harvard Secondary School. I like to listen to books during my commute to and from school, and on the side I'm interested in mechanics and chemistry.
