__Description about me:__
I'm an enthusastic teenager that is self taught in a couple of languages. 
In my free time, I row for my high school rowing program, and I love to workout. 
Currently, I attend Boston College High School, and Harvard Secondary School. I like to listen to books during my commute to and from school, and on the side I'm interested in mechanics and chemistry.


*In an effort to make my profile as unique as possible, I have decided to inclue this picture of a cat I found on the internet. While not deep in meaning, it's a cat.*

*Additionally, I've decided to inclue a recent binary joke I heard*

>There are 10 types of people who understand binary. 

>Those who do, and those who don't.
