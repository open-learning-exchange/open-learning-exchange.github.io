My name is *Gabby* I just finished the General Assembly WDI program in **Boston** where I learned the following languages:
1. Javascript
2. Ruby on Rails
3. Ember
4. and more...

I hope to learn a lot more through [Open Learning Exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io "Open Learning Exchange")
This is my project portfolio site [portfolio](https://ggwilliams.github.io/portfolio//)

I enjoy:
* FrontEnd 
* Javascript Algorithms
* Code Challenges

When I have ~~freetime~~, I like to:
* Practice more coding problems
* Watch tv
* Play with my dogs
* Hang out with familt

Right now, I am currently living in **Boston** but I am looking to move to **Chicago**. I am hoping to find a software engineer job there.

I have two dogs
