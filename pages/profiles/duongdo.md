## Short Paragraph

My name is [Duong Do](https://github.com/duongdo27/), a junior majoring at Computer Science in Saint John's University, MN. 
The coursework at SJU prepares me solid background knowledge and experience in programming. I am comfortable with various languages including Python, Java, C++. As a fast learner, I understand class material quickly and stay on top of the class, then I become a teaching assistant in the sophomore year. By teaching other students, I improve both my knowledge and communication skill. In my free time, I like to explore interesting languages and libraries. I have experience with HTML and CSS. One of my projects is a Heroku web application which collects and stores data from various public APIs into a SQLite database. Users can search and visualize useful information and statistics from these data. The visualization is built with AngularJS and Bokeh library. Last summer, I get a research position at the Computer Science department, in which I create and maintain a Jekyll-based blog-like website dedicated to teaching various aspects of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Software. Last but not least, I love challenges and always willing to learn new technology.
