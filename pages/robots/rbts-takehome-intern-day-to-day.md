# Take Home Intern Day-to-Day

## Mobile Intern Mission

As a Take Home/Mobile Intern your primary job is to improve the Take Home application while making it easier for newer interns to make progress on the Take Home application. This idea is the core thought you should have day-to-day. You should ask yourself these two questions whenever you dedicate some work hours towards your internship.

* “How can I improve the Take Home application today?”

* “How can I make it easier for new interns to make progress on the Take Home Application?”

If the things you do during your short time here can answer both of these questions, you will be a great asset to the mobile team.

## How to Improve the Take Home Application

Improving the Take Home Application is a lot easier to say then to actually do. Once you dive into fixing an issue you will understand what I mean. You can accomplish this in two different ways.

1.	You can solve an issue already created in the [Take Home GitHub](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/take-home/issues).

2.	You can create a new issue and solve it.

Solving an already created issue is fairly straight forward. Creating a new issue and solving it can be done in a variety of ways. Getting the Take Home application up and [running in the Android Studio](rbts-takehome-android-studio-setup.md) should be your first step. Then simply mess around with the application. If you find any issues or improvements either to the UI or functionality, create a new issue and try to solve it.

## How to Make It Easier for New Interns

It is paramount that while you are discovering how the Take Home application works you keep the mindset of documenting your precise steps you have taken and pit falls you have avoided so that interns that join the team after you can quickly become familiar with the applications code without making the same mistakes you did. If you don’t document, more than likely new mobile interns are going to make the same mistakes. If you are improving the Take Home code, writing a new script or doing anything to improve the quality of life of the Take Home project and you come across a step or guide that you think others would benefit from, please document it.

I don’t know how to stress the importance of this point any further. The 3 months, 18 hours a week, is very short, so any steps to help other interns to make their time more efficient will have a ripple affect long after you are done with this internship.

You can document your findings by either adding to [existing guides](rbts-takehome.md) (including this guide) or by creating new ones.

I know for some of you English is not your first language, which is completely fine. You can still be an effective intern by improving the Take Home code and solving issues for the Take Home application. But, If you come across an important improvement to a guide or want to create a new guide, but don’t feel confident in your ability to convey it in a guide you can then ask some who is confident to listen to it in voice chat, [http://talk.ole.org](talk.ole.org), and they can then convert it into a guide/new step for you. Just don’t wear out your welcome with this option on other interns.

## Weekly Mobile Intern Goals

With your 18 hours each week you should try and do one of the following two things each week (or to really impress me, do both).

1.	Improve the Take Home application.

    OR

2.	Update Take Home guides to help future interns.
