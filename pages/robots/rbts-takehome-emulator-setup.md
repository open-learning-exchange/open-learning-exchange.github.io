## Logging in on Android Emulator

The Take Home application by default is setup to run on an actual Android device. You will need to modify the IP address in the Setup menu on the Member Login screen to be able to login successfully using the Android Emulator.

Note: You must have completed the [First Steps](#!pages/vi/vi-first-steps.md) that relate to Vagrant in order for your Android Emulator to work. Make sure you can log-into MyBeLL before continuing these steps.*

First, you need to find your IP address.

For Windows, Open Command Prompt and type ```ipconfig``` in the window.

For macOS and Ubuntu, Open Terminal and type ```ifconfig``` in the terminal.

Second, you need to find your port number in MyBeLL.

Finally, You will combine both numbers into this format ```http://192.168.1.213:5985``` and then place it into the Setup menu inside the Take Home application.

After entering the IP and Port, click "Test". You should be prompted with a success screen.

You should now be able to sign into the Take Home application using the same login information that you use for MyBeLL.
