>My name is [**Evan Purdy**](https://github.com/waryhermit), I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Binghamton University. During my studies I found I really enjoyed the programming classes I took, and I have been programming in my spare time since. I look forward to getting a chance to work on [OLE software](http://www.ole.org/) and see if a CS/Programming career switch is for me. When I am not programming, I like to play Starcraft II and Overwatch.
