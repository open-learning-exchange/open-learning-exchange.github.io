#Evan Purdy
Eastern Standard Time, Windows 10 - Insider Preview (Fast Ring)

My name is Evan Purdy, I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Binghamton University. During my studies I found I really enjoyed the programming classes I took, and I have been programming in my spare time since. I look forward to getting a chance to work on OLE software and see if a CS/Programming career switch is for me.
In my spare time I like to play Starcraft II and Overwatch.
