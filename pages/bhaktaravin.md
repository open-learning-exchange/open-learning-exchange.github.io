My name is Ravin Bhakta and I am a student at California State University Los Angeles majoring in Computer Science. 
I am a fast learner when it comes to programming languages. I have always been interested in programming because thats what 
makes a computer work the way that it does. I'm always looking for new languages that I can pick up whether if I'm at school or 
at home.
