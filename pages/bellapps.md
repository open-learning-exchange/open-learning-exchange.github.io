# BeLL-Apps: Communities and Nations
## Objectives
* Understand how the BeLL-Apps interface is structured
* Add resources to your Community in order to get accustomed to the BeLL-Apps interface
  
After submitting your configurations in step 1, you should be registered by now. you will be able to see the main dashboard of the BeLL.

Watch the videos below to learn the basic functions of your BeLL. These videos are a little old as they were created 2 years ago, but they should do a decent job of orienting you to the BeLL.   

[My Dashboard Video](uploads/movies/mydashboard.mp4)

[Library](uploads/movies/library.mp4)

[Feedback](uploads/movies/feedback.mp4)

[Generating Activity Reports](uploads/movies/generatingactivityreports.mp4)

We advise you to play around a bit, as well. Try to explore and feel comfortable with the software, as you'll be using it quite a bit during your internship.

We also want you to practice uploading resources to the BeLL. Although there are several different kinds of resources, most of them are either PDFs, mp3s, or mp4s. We provided you with some resources (linked below) that you can download and then upload to your BeLL.

[Here is the first page of the PDF "Feelings"](uploads/pdf/feelings.pdf)
[Here is the song "Opposite Song"](uploads/music/oppositesong.mp3)
[Here is the video "Burka Avenger"](uploads/movies/burkaavenger.mp4)

Click on each one of these links and right-click to save them to your desktop.

From there, go to your Vagrant BeLL. Select `Library` from the dashboard and then select `Add a Resource`. You will then be prompted to go to this page:

Fill out the information, although as we are just doing this as a test, accuracy of information/source of content is not very important. Just be sure to put something, even if it is your name (as in the example above). The important thing is that you have something in all of the drop-down menus and that you choose the correct format for the `Open` menu (e.g., PDF, mp3, or mp4). Then, click on `Save`. You have now uploaded the resource. Next, you should find it and make sure that you can open it. Repeat the same process for all three resources.

>Do not forget to send the screenshot of your community configurations (from earlier when you registered your configurations) to our chat.

In case you forgot to take the screenshot of your configurations, go to http://127.0.0.1:5985/apps/_design/bell/MyApp/index.html, then click on manager, click on the configurations tab, take a screenshot of the page, and submit it to the Gitter chat.
