I am a self-motivated and curious junior web and mobile developer, and I am ardent about creating new technologies and 
applications that can change lives and contribute to meaningful user experiences. Above all things I value professionalism at all levels, 
from coding to interacting with clients. Having had the opportunity to work on real production application, I am driven and 
determined to embrace and resolve any challenges.
