## Porting HTML App to CouchApp

Prerequisites:

* [Couchapp](#couchapp-installation)
* Couchdb Instance
* Desired JavaScript/HTML application


## Couchapp Installation

#### Linux/OSX
Clone the [couchapp repository](https://github.com/couchapp/couchapp.git), build and install it. Run the following commands in the directory of your choice (from a terminal):

```
git clone https://github.com/couchapp/couchapp.git
cd couchapp
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```

_Note:_
If you get an error message, `ImportError: No module named setuptools`, then we
need to install  [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) first.
This is a [common issue](https://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=ImportError:+No+module+named+setuptools), but easily solved.

The following command should take care of this:

`> curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python`

#### Windows
There are two possible methods for installing python, method 1 requires you to install python and other prerequisites. Method 2 is a standalone .exe file.

*Method 1*  

There's a good amount of prerequisites for the couchapp installation on Windows.

1. Download Python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This method only works with version 2.7. If you use a Python installer with a UI, select the option to add Python to PATH. If not (or if that doesn't work) follow [these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#excursus-setting-environment-variables). Test that Python is in your PATH with `python --version`.
2. Download setuptools by following the instructions for Windows [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).
3. Download py2exe by following the instructions [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2exe/0.9.2.0/) (or [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/) if you're using Python 2.7 or below).
4. Download pywin32 [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20220/).
5. Download curl by opening powershell with admin access and typing `choco install curl`

Once you have all of these, clone the [couchapp repository](https://github.com/couchapp/couchapp.git), build and install it. Run the following commands in the directory of your choice (from a terminal):

```
git clone https://github.com/couchapp/couchapp.git
cd couchapp
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

NOTE:
Make sure to check for error messages (found at the bottom of the blocks of text created when running these commands) when building and installing the couchapp. For example, if you're using Python 2.7, you may be prompted to install the [Visual C++ Compiler](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266). If you do get an error message, let us know in the Gitter chat, and we'll do our best to help you.

*Method 2*

Click [here](https://couchapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/couchapp/install.html#installing-on-windows) and scroll down to the "Installing on Windows" section. Click on the first link 'Standalone Executable 1.0.2'. This will download the couchapp-1.0.2-win32.exe. Run the .exe file by double clicking it. When the installation is complete make sure the "Add couchapp to path" box is checked and finish the installation.

Note:
If you have windows 7  and you get an error message on the next step, you may need to install Visual C++ 9.0 [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266). Then install 'http-parser' by typing into your terminal:

```
pip install http-parser
```

### Generating the couchapp
Using `couchapp generate` command you will be able to generate the structure of a couchapp, but first, you need to create a folder with the app name and then, access to it.

```
$ mkdir test
$ cd test
$ couchapp generate test
```

In this case I will generate the app called *"test"*

```
$ couchapp generate test
[WARNING] "genrate app" will be deprecated in future release. Please use "init -t TEMPLATE" instead.
[INFO] /Users/ignacio/Desktop/ole/test created.
```


After you run it, you will need to edit the file `.couchapprc` in order to add the server path.

The file should be like the one shown below. In this file, `db` is the server path, in my case it is `http://127.0.0.1:5985`, followed by `testapp`. Where `testapp` is the database where I want to insert the app.

> The database name can only contain lowercase characters (a-z), digits (0-9), and any of the characters _, $, (, ), +, -, and / are allowed. It must begin with a letter.


```
{
    "env" : {
        "myserver" : {
            "db" : "http://127.0.0.1:5985/testapp"
        }
    }
}
```

Also you can edit some fields, like `name` and `description`  in the file `couchapp.json`

```
{
    "name": "Test app",
    "description": "Testing couchapps"
}
```

### Adding content to the app and pushing it
Now that you have generated the app, you will need to add the original app data ~~(the one you're porting)~~ to `_attachments` folder. You may want to remove everything inside that folder before you add the new content. You can remove all items inside it and copy the data with the following terminal commands:

```
rm -rf _attachments/*
cp -r /home/user/myoriginalapp/* _attachments/
```
Or for Windows:
```
rd /s /q c:\Users\%username%\couchapp\test\_attachments
md c:\Users\%username%\couchapp\test\_attachments
xcopy c:\Users\%username%\appIwantToTransfer c:\Users\%username%\couchapp\test\_attachments
```

Now that you have done all those steps, you will need to upload the app to the server: `couchapp push myserver` where `myserver` is the one you specified in the `.couchapprc` file.

```
$ couchapp push myserver
[INFO] Visit your CouchApp here:
http://127.0.0.1:5985/testapp/_design/test/index.html
```

After this, The app will be available on the specified link. You should be able to see the database in http://127.0.0.1:5985/_utils/database.html?testapp

## Adding the app as resource to Bell App Library

### Link Library resource to CouchDB database
The next step is to properly link a Library resource to the database containing the HTML app's data that you created.

First, you need to add a [New Dummy Resource](http://127.0.0.1:5985/apps/_design/bell/MyApp/index.html#resources) so it's easier to copy the template for resources into the actual new resource. Set the `Open` parameter to HTML, and write the additional info required, but don't attach any files.

Now we have to mess around with some things in the [CouchDB](http://127.0.0.1:5985/_utils/). For ease of viewing, make sure to change "Rows per page:" to 50 or higher. You can see the resource you just added in the database titled `resources`.

![dummyresourceincouch](uploads/images/dummy-couch-resource.png)

Next, go into the folder on your computer where your couchapp is located, go into the `.couchapprc` file, and change the value for `db` to ```"http://127.0.0.1:5985/resources"```. This changes the directory of the next `couchapp push` to the `resources` database.

Now we need a random `_id` value for the new Library resource. ```curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5985/_uuids``` will generate a random UUID. Copy that value from your command prompt/terminal and replace the value in the `_id` file with the random UUID.

![randomcouchappid](uploads/images/random-couchapp-id.png)

Once these changes have been made, ```couchapp push myserver``` again. The app will be available at the URL specified.

This next part is the most complicated, so make sure to pay extra attention here. Go to the [CouchDB](http://127.0.0.1:5985/_utils/) and open the *dummy resource* you made in one tab and the *app you just pushed* in another tab (both of which can be found in the `resources` database). As you can see when you compare your app and the dummy resource, the app is missing fields that are necessary for it to be usable in the Library. So now, go to the dummy resource click the "Source" tab. Double-click the source and copy everything from the dummy resource EXCEPT the `_id` and `_rev` fields.

![dummyresourcesfieldstocopy](uploads/images/dummy-resource-fields.png)

Then, go into the "Source" of your app and paste those fields below the `_rev` field. Remember to put a comma after the last line you paste (`"timesRated": 0`) and feel free to change the `title` field to the name of your app.

![pastedfieldsincouchapp](uploads/images/pasted-fields.png)

If you scroll down to the `_attachments` field, you'll find a reference to an .html file called `index.html` or `main.html` or something along those lines. Cut the reference and all of its info and put it at the beginning of the `_attachments` field like so:

![cutpasteindexhtml](uploads/images/cutpaste-indexhtml.png)

Once you make these changes, click `Save Document`. You should now be able to find your app in the [Library](http://127.0.0.1:5985/apps/_design/bell/MyApp/index.html#resources)!

### Push New App to Nation
Now delete your dummy resource by clicking `Delete`. Then click `Open` on you html resource to test it out.

![finalstep1](uploads/images/Final_Step_1.png)

Finally, push your app to the nation by clicking `Add to Nation`.
