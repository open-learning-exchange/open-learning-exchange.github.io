Hello! I am an upcoming Senior at the University of California, Riverside studying Computer Science and Engineering. 
I enjoy working on interesting team-based projects within the realm of software engineering.
From my curriculum, I have learned a great deal of information in the field of Computer Science and I am always willing to learn new things.
I also enjoy engaging in deep, thought provoking conversations about the origins of space, deep space exploration, or any new scientific advances!
