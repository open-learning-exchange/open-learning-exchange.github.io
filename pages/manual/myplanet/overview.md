## Introduction

myPlanet is a mobile application that serves as an offline version of the Planet learning system. It allows users to access the learning resources, such as books, videos, and learning games, provided by the Planet server. With myPlanet, users can have an offline learning experience and access the extensive library of learning materials without the need for internet connectivity.

The mobile app acts as a bridge between the user's device and the Planet server, enabling the synchronization of data. It allows learners to download selected collections of learning resources from the server and store them locally on their mobile devices. This personalized approach to learning ensures that learners can access the materials that are most relevant to their needs and interests.

Additionally, myPlanet provides software tools for content and learner management, learner evaluation and monitoring, and course creation. Learners can manage their learning progress, track their performance, and engage with interactive learning activities through the mobile app. The app also supports frequent assessments and provides usage feedback metrics, making it a valuable tool for learners, coaches, and administrators.

By leveraging the capabilities of myPlanet, learners can access the vast repository of learning resources from the Planet system anytime and anywhere, even in remote locations with unreliable or no internet connectivity. The mobile app enhances the accessibility and usability of the Planet learning system, providing an inclusive and seamless learning experience for users of all ages and levels of expertise.
