OLE’s mission is to ensure learning for all, not only universal basic literacy and numeracy, but also vital knowledge and skills acquisition in the areas of health, nutrition, community development.

We believe this will lead to:
- **More productive lives**

- Formats: **Text, audio, video**  

### Flexible Access

- Can also run **locally** on a **Raspberry Pi server** (a small, affordable, low-power computer)  
- Works in **areas with little or no internet connection**  
- Requires **very low power**, so it can run even from a **portable battery (power bank)**  

### Monitoring & Evaluation
Planet makes it easy to track progress by providing:

### Nations
  * **Nations** always exist in the cloud and require an internet connection to access.
  * Each **Nation** serves as a central repository for the **Community** or a group of communities that it serves.
  * Different **Nations** cannot connect to each other.

### Communities
  * A **Community** is a local installation of the Planet system.
  * A **Community** does not require an internet to access.
  * Users can connect to a **Community** using any device with access to a web browser, such as a tablet, computer, etc. The connection is established via a router through a locally configured _intranet_.
  * Each **Community** connects periodically to a **Nation** via _internet_ in order to receive new materials and to upload user metrics.
  * A **Community** is not able to connect to other **Communities**. 

The **nations** may store thousands of Resources in many formats and languages. Unique collections of Resources can be selected and downloaded into each **Community** from the **Nation**. This gives a Learner a personalized approach to his or her education.
