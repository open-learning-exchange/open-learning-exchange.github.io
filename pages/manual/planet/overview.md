OLE’s mission is to ensure learning for all, not only universal basic literacy and numeracy, but also vital knowledge and skills acquisition in the areas of health, nutrition, community development.

- Formats: **Text, audio, video**  

### Flexible Access

- Can also run **locally** on a **Raspberry Pi server** (a small, affordable, low-power computer)  
- Works in **areas with little or no internet connection**  
- Requires **very low power**, so it can run even from a **portable battery (power bank)**  

### Monitoring & Evaluation
Planet makes it easy to track progress by providing:

### Nations
  * **Nations** always exist in the cloud and require an internet connection to access.
  * Each **Nation** serves as a central repository for the **Community** or a group of communities that it serves.
  * Different **Nations** cannot connect to each other.

### Communities
  * A **Community** is a local installation of the Planet system.
  * A **Community** does not require an internet to access.
  * Users can connect to a **Community** using any device with access to a web browser, such as a tablet, computer, etc. The connection is established via a router through a locally configured _intranet_.
  * Each **Community** connects periodically to a **Nation** via _internet_ in order to receive new materials and to upload user metrics.
  * A **Community** is not able to connect to other **Communities**. 

The **nations** may store thousands of Resources in many formats and languages. Unique collections of Resources can be selected and downloaded into each **Community** from the **Nation**. This gives a Learner a personalized approach to his or her education.
