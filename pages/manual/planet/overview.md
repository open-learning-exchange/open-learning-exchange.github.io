## About OLE

The [**Open Learning Exchange (OLE)**](http://ole.org) is committed to ensuring that everyone, especially children, has access to a high-quality basic education. We collaborate with community-based entrepreneurs, educators, and practitioners worldwide to promote effective and affordable learning systems for everyone. We believe this will lead to more productive lives, communities, and nations, and to the possibility of a peaceful world. 

OLE’s mission is to ensure learning for all, not only universal basic literacy and numeracy, but also vital knowledge and skills acquisition in the areas of health, nutrition, community development. Since 2007, OLE International has helped establish Open Learning Communities for children, adolescents, and young adults, including those whose lives have been disrupted by violent conflicts.  Today there are OLE affiliates in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.

## Introduction

### _What is the OLE Planet Learning System (Planet)?_

Personalized Learning And Networked Enabled Teams (Planet) is a multilingual learning system and library with thousands of educational resources including books, videos, and educational games. The system also includes software tools for content and student management, student evaluation and monitoring, and Courses creation.

At it's core, Planet is a repository of free, open access, and public domain resources designed to support learners of all ages and backgrounds. Resources of all kinds (literature, health, science, math, etc.), in various languages (English, Somali, Swahili, Arabic, Spanish, etc.), and in various formats (text, audio, video) are continually being added to Planet.

The Planet system operates in the cloud but can also be configured to run locally, such as on a Raspberry Pi server. This setup allows access to the system in areas with unreliable or no internet connection, and the Raspberry Pi’s low power requirements make it suitable for power-limited environments, even when using a power bank.

Planet facilitates frequent assessments of learners, leaders, and administrators. It also promotes the evaluation and effectiveness of the learning resources. Robust usage feedback metrics make Planet a powerful tool for those overseeing monitoring and evaluation of the education system.

### _What are Planet Nations and Communities?_

Under the Planet system, there are two types of structures: **Nations** and **Communities**.

* **Nations**
  * **Nations** always exist in the cloud and require an internet connection to access.
  * Each **Nation** serves as a central repository for the **Community** or a group of communities that it serves.
  * Different **Nations** cannot connect to each other.

* **Communities**
  * A **Community** is a local installation of the Planet system.
  * A **Community** does not require an internet to access.
  * Users can connect to a **Community** using any device with access to a web browser, such as a tablet, computer, etc. The connection is established via a router through a locally configured _intranet_.
  * Each **Community** connects periodically to a **Nation** via _internet_ in order to receive new materials and to upload user metrics.
  * A **Community** is not able to connect to other **Communities**.

The **nations** may store thousands of Resources in many formats and languages. Unique collections of Resources can be selected and downloaded into each **Community** from the **Nation**. This gives a Learner a personalized approach to his or her education.
