## Using collection of resource
The admin of the community can create "Collections" to categorize the resources. Members can also use these collections to view different groups of resources.

On this page, you can open the resource in a new tab, add it to your library, and download it to your computer. In the resource viewer itself, you can also search for terms, jump to pages, zoom, and more.
