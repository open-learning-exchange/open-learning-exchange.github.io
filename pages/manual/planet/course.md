## Course Collections

Course collections are the categories that a course can have, assisting in finding a desired course when you want to search your list of courses by category.

Collections can be standalone without being a subcollection of another collection, or can set another collection as its supercollection, as long as that supercollection is not a supercollection of another collection. In other words, there can only be one layer of collection to subcollection correlation.

There are two ways of filtering the Courses page by collection:

![Filtering](images/courses-filtering.png)

1. By clicking on the "Collections" button next to "Courses" on the top-left of the page. This will bring up a module where you can filter the course list on the Courses page by selecting checkboxes next to collections and subcollections, seeing only the courses that have these collections or subcollections. 

You are also able to edit the course's name or subcollection status from this module.

![Filtered](images/courses-filtered.png)

2. By clicking directly on the collection name listed under the course, you can filter the courses by the clicked collection. Free collections are blue while subcollections are gray.

Note that this filtering is not retroactive, and clicking on a subcollection to click on its supercollection afterwards will not update the filtering to filter by the supercollection.
