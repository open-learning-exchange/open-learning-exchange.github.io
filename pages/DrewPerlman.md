I'm Drew, a rising sophomore at the University of Southern California studying Interactive Media and Game Design with a Computer Science minor. Though I'm very interested in game development, I enjoy programming and plan to specialize in that. I'm looking forward to developing my skills and contributing to OLE's cause.
