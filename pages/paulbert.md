# Paul Albert

I'm a former advertising/web analyst in Somerville who decided to make a career change to get into web development.  I studied music in college and focused on composition.  **This means:**

### Instruments I am comfortable playing in front of people
* Voice
* Guitar
* Electric Bass Guitar
* Ukulele

**and**

### Instruments I have played music that is not nonsense
* Piano
* Flute
* Drum Set
* Double/Upright Bass

I also enjoy traveling, cooking, soccer, and ultimate frisbee.
