## Blake DeLee - UMass Boston - Computer Science - Graduating December 2017
I live in Boston, MA.

I do most of my work on a Windows 10 machine, but I do have access to an Ubuntu VM, a straight Unix VM, and a MacBook for Mac OS.

I enjoy learning new things, and especially coding.  A few of the languages I have experience in are:

* C / C++  
* Java  
* Lisp / Scheme  
* SQL / PL SQL / Oracle  
* Assembly  
* HTML

A hobby of mine is Overwatch.  I'm currently rank 3900.  I also like to play basketball and go biking.  I also just adopted an adorable one-eyed black kitten.

I will be making an web-based Overwatch tool in the near future, until then, the [link](http://counter.watch) just points to my Stream team.

Here is a picture of Ash, the kitten:
