Hello! I am a recent graduate with Masterâ€™s in Computer Science fom California State University,Chico with focus on backend development. I was a Student Assistant at California State University, Chico, where I assisted students, having various disabilities, with technology related problems. I also coordinated with them for their study related difficulties. In Spring-2015 we had to develop a multiplayer game in C++. In Summer-2015 I developed an Android Application for sharing pictures with friends. During my Fall-2014 semester I was introduced to various networking and routing protocols. During the progress of the course various group projects and lab assignments gave me an insight into security of networking. I also had a number of programming assignments during this period, which helped me develop and hone my coding skills. 
I am a huge fan of Star Wars , Harry Potter, Supernatural, Friends, The Flash, or anything that is related to Sciene Fiction or Comics.
