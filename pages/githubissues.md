##GitHub Issues

On GitHub, each repository has a section where issues can be added, discussed, and fixed as a means of categorizing and addressing problems we find. Issues are often opened by our team to fix software bugs on the BeLL and in our code. Below, you'll find an example of an issue where I brought up a problem, researched an answer, and then fixed the issue.

First, you will need to open an issue within the right repository and explain the problem. If you are explaining a bug or how to replicate an issue, please be as explicit as possible and use pictures if possible.

After this, you will then research the possible solutions or ideas on how to address the issue and write a comment with this information, as you can see [here](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io/issues/15). Someone else will hopefuly provide input (as Dogi did here) and then you can move ahead with making the proposed changes. 

On your own fork of the correct repository, go and make the proposed changes and commit them once you have finished. Then, request a pull request of the changes and wait until one of the OLE staff accepts the changes and pull request to merge. You can see this process [here](https://github.com/EmilyLarkin/EmilyLarkin.github.io/commit/b335125e4c9af9e4ea57b5f5fd1629845732a6c4). 

After this, a staff member will accept the pull request and will normally close the issue. You can see the process [here](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io/issues/15).
