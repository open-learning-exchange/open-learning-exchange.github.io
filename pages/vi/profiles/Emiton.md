## About Me:
I am a software engineering student with a background in Mechanical Engineering. I was introduced to programming during my senior year and became interested in learning on my own. After taking a few courses and teaching myself during my free time, I was able to enroll in a Master's program for CS. In my freetime, I am currently working with web technologies like MEAN stack and also building web applications using C#.
