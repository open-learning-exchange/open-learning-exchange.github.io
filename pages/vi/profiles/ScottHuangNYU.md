## About Me
Hi guys, I just graduated from New York University. I am focused on using java to handle the back-end part of web appliation and I believe this virtual intern opportunity would be a great chance for me to become more proficient in latest programming practices and to work at a team environment. In the mean time, I could give back and help disadvantaged communities. I look forward working with you all.
