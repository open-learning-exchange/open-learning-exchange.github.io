## About Me
A computer geek who adores all things technology. My free time is dedicated to competing in programming contests and hackathons, automating things around the house with Python, developing applications, and studying VR and AI tech.

I recently graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I was born and raised in the United Arab Emirates, and came to Pennsylvania for my undergraduate studies. 

I believe this virtual internship is a great opportunity for me to contribute to an open-source project that will touch the lives of millions. And is an ideal way a humble developer such as myself could give back and help disadvantaged communities. I look forward to helping you make the world a better place.
