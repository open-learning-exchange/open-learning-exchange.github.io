## About Me

Hello everyone, I am pursuing my Master's in software engineering from San Jose State University. I had completed undergrad in computer engineering.
I am exploring emerging technologies for my future endeavour. I think virtual intern would be great opportunity to leverage my technical skills and communication skills.
It would be great to work in a team environment and solving issues. I hope my willingness to contribute in future result in amazing adventures. looking forward to work with everyone on team.
