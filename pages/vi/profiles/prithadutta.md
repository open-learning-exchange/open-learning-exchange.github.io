### Introduction
Hi, I am Pritha Dutta, a graduate student at University of New Hampshire with a major in Information Technology. During my first year of this degree program so far, I had a formal coursework on subjects like object-oriented programming language, web programming applications, database management, networking fundamentals, big data etc. Prior to coming to this graduate program, I worked as an automation software test engineer at Tech Mahindra, India for three and half years. To hone my technical skills further, I find the summer internship opportunity at OLE will be truly beneficial. Therefore I am keenly looking forward to an wonderful learning experience through this internship.
