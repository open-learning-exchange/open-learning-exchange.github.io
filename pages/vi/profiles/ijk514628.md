## About Me
Hi all, I'm a recent Applied Math graduate . I was born and raised in [Guangdong, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong) and came to U.S for my undergraduate study. I believe this virtual intern opportunity would be a great chance for me to become more proficient in latest programming practices and to thrive in a team environment. In the mean time, I could give back and help disadvantaged communities. I look forward working with you all.
