I'm from Boston, MA so based in the EST time zone of course. I am currently a sophomore at UMass Lowell, majoring in Computer Science. So far my courses have been primarily taught in C, but next semester we are taking the step up to C++ so I'm naturally quite excited for that experience. I've had experience in a few languages, but given the extent of my coursework, I am by far most adept at C, but am always excited to learn more! I've made up a chart to list some of my proficiency/familiarity levels with different languages:


| Language      | Proficiency   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| C             | Proficient |
| C++           | Familiar/Low Intermediate    |
| Python        | Limited Experience     |
| HTML          | Intermediate     |
| CSS           | Intermediate     |
| Javascript    | Intermediate    |
| Bootstrap     | Beginner     |

I've done some minor web development work, but nothing to the extent of the work at OLE so I'm really looking forward to the opportunity of learning and working on a project of this scale.

* Basketball (_Huge Celtics fan, and love playing as well_)
* Soccer
* I used to play a ton of Video Games, but quit them in the name of productivity. Instead I discovered internet Chess and fell in love with that :/
* Now instead of playing Video Games, I watch them, with CS:GO and Dota 2 being the primary examples (*Huge EG and Cloud9 supporter*)
* When I'm at school I enjoy going out with friends, and having a good time
* Lastly, I've been building desktops since I was 12, and am looking forward to building a new machine this summer (*[Ryzen's](https://www.amd.com/en/ryzen) got me really hyped...*)

My primary computer is a Macbook Pro, so I mainly use Mac OS X (*10.12.4 currently*) for coding, but I also utilize [reFind](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) to dual-boot an Ubuntu (_16.04_) partition. I also have an older Windows 7 desktop at home.
