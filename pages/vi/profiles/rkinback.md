I recieved two Bachelor of Science degrees; one in Biology and one in
Electro-mechanical Engineering. I have worked as firmware engineer and a 
Software engineer, but my favorite thing to do is develop Android applications
and work on new uses for mobile technology. In my spare time I enjoy working on 
robotics and lifting weights.
