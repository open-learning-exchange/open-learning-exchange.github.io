  1. *Notes on the Peanut*
  
  **June Jordan, 1936 - 2002**

  For the Poet David Henderson

Hi there. My name is George  
Washington  
Carver.  
If you bear with me  
for a few minutes I  
will share with you  
a few  
of the 30,117 uses to which  
the lowly peanut has been put  
by me  
since yesterday afternoon.  
If you will look at my feet you will notice  
my sensible shoelaces made from unadulterated  
peanut leaf composition that is biodegradable  
in the extreme.  
To your left you can observe the lovely Renoir  
masterpiece reproduction that I have cleverly  
pieced together from several million peanut  
shell chips painted painstakingly so as to  
accurately represent the colors of the original!  
Overhead you will spot a squadron of Peanut B-52  
Bombers flying due west.  
I would extend my hands to greet you  
at this time  
except for the fact that I am holding a reserve  
supply of high energy dry roasted peanuts  
guaranteed to accelerate protein assimilation  
precisely documented by my pocket peanut calculator;  

May I ask when did you last contemplate the relationship  
between the expanding peanut products industry  
and the development of post-Marxian economic theory  
which (Let me emphasize) need not exclude moral attrition  
of prepuberty  
polymorphic  
prehensile skills within the population age sectors  
of 8 to 15?  
I hope you will excuse me if I appear to be staring at you  
through these functional yet high fashion and prescriptive  
peanut contact lenses providing for the most  
minute observation of your physical response to all of this  
ultimately nutritional information.  
Peanut butter peanut soap peanut margarine peanut  
brick houses and house and field peanut per se well  
illustrate the diversified  
potential of this lowly leguminous plant  
to which you may correctly refer  
also  
as the goober the pindar the groundnut  
and the ground pea/let me  
interrupt to take your name down on my  
pocket peanut writing pad complete with matching  
peanut pencil that only 3 or 4  
chewing motions of the jaws will sharpen  
into pyrotechnical utility  
and no sweat.  
Please:  
Speak right into the peanut!
