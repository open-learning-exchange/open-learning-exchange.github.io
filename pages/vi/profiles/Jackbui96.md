## Self Introduction

Hello everyone and welcome to my Wiki page.  
I hope that you will enjoy your stay here.  

A little bit about myself.  
My name is Nguyen Bui (Jack), a junior international student from Vietnam.    
I am currently working toward my B.S in Software Engineering at San Jose State University.  
I specialize in developing Android App and maintaining databases.  
My goal is to learn and get a hand-on experience as much as possible before graduating.  
I am a fun and easy going guy.  
Fun fact: I am a huge fanboy of 9gag and meme.

  >If you bear with me  
  >for a few minutes I  
  >will share with you  
  >a few  
  >of the 30,117 uses to which  
  >the lowly peanut has been put  
  >by me  
  >since yesterday afternoon.  
  >If you will look at my feet you will notice  
  >my sensible shoelaces made from unadulterated  
  >peanut leaf composition that is biodegradable  
  >in the extreme.  
  >To your left you can observe the lovely Renoir  
  >masterpiece reproduction that I have cleverly  
  >pieced together from several million peanut  
  >shell chips painted painstakingly so as to  
  >accurately represent the colors of the original!  
  >Overhead you will spot a squadron of Peanut B-52  
  >Bombers flying due west.  
  >I would extend my hands to greet you  
  >at this time  
  >except for the fact that I am holding a reserve  
  >supply of high energy dry roasted peanuts  
  >guaranteed to accelerate protein assimilation  
  >precisely documented by my pocket peanut calculator;   

  >May I ask when did you last contemplate the relationship
