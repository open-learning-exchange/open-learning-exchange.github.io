## About Me

---
- Originally from Batna a small city in the northeast of Algeria.
- Moved to the U.S. (Brooklyn, New York) in 2015 for education.
- Learning how to coding was a big part of who I wanted to be. 
- I'm a self taught coder for the most part and I really like it. 
- Now I'm in a coding bootcamp graduating in 08/2019 for Web Development.
- I'm always enthusiastic about learning new stuff, which brings me to this opportunity. 
- I'm very excited to work with all of the Open Learning Exchange Team and also make new friends.
