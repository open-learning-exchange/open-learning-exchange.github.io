## About Me
I am a recent graduate from Oregon State University, with a *Bachelors of Science* degree in *Computer Science*, aiming to expand my software engineering experience through internships to fill gaps in my resume. I like running, biking, and hiking whenever the weather is optimal :sunny:. I also run sometimes in the rain but that's a different experience.

After graduating, I focused extensively on hands-on Udemy courses to develop experience with full-stack development. I recently created myself a web app with the following technologies:
* NodeJs
* React
* Redux (with Thunk)
* Express
* Firestore

The web app is hosted through Google Cloud Platform App Engine, via Docker. I originally used MongoDB for the back-end, and hosted through Azure DevOps pipelines but deciced to switch to GCP. You can check my web app, along with my favorite projects, at [AstroClimb](https://astroclimb.appspot.com/).
