## Introduction
Hi all, I'm a Software Engineer. I was born and raised in [Rawalpindi, Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi) .
I am good in coding and familiar with bunch of programming languages like c, c# , java , Php ,Python and used to many php frameworks like laravel , magento and wordpres.Also I made apps on android studio, Ionic, Framework 7 (hybrid Apps) and used Google APIs for my project.I have learned Machine learning from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and used for Final year Project thesis by implementing Neural Network Algorithm for Rating Prediction and ARIMA model for Trend Prediction.

I believe this virtual intern opportunity would be a great chance for me to become more proficient in latest programming practices and to thrive in a team environment. In the mean time, I could give back and help disadvantaged communities. I look forward working with you all.
