## About Me
Hi everyone! I graduated from the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp in May 2019, where I studied JavaScript, jQuery, React, Node.js 
and more. I was also a community organizer for 7 years for immigrant rights and climate justice, and love to do work that 
uplifts communities. I was born and raised in Lima, Peru and migrated to the U.S. with my family when I was 11 years old. 
I'm excited to be part of the virtual interns team at OLE. I believe it will help me to become more proficient in programming and 
challenge me to continue growing as a developer. I look forward to collaborating with you all!
