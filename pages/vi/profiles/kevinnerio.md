# Kevin Nerio | CSULB Senior | Web Developer
### Los Angeles | Mac OS High Sierra 

I am originally from Los Angeles and I grew up playing video games. This led to my current interest in understanding everything that goes into creating software & applications. 
That is why I am currently looking to intern as a software engineer.
