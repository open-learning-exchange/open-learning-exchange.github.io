##### 
I am a fourth year Computer Science undergraduate student at Columbus State University with an interest in software 
engineering, mobile application development, and machine learning. I knew programming was my calling when I wrote my 
first line of python code. I love how it gives me the ability to use logical problem solving and creativity which 
really drives me.
