## About Me
My name is **George**. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Mercy University and I graduated on May of 2024. My motivation is building and problem solving. There are aspects in my life that I see potential improvement with the implementation of software development. I'm in my way of becoming an embedded systems engineer in my future. Combining both hardware and software to fufill productivity and make life more easier is something that I always admired. 

In my free time, I tinker with hardware technologies, micro controllers, and other software tools to fufill my ideas. I used programs like kicad to design pcb's in my past. 

At the moment Im focusing a lot more on software since its an area in my future field that I want to master.
