# My name is Akrish.

I'm on the **west coast time zone or PT**. I use **Mac OS X El Capitan**. I am a **college student** at Reed College in Portland, OR studying French literature and computer science. I am _so excited_ to work with OLE!

I like to write clean code with documentation:

```python
def tryDefine(word):

	localSearch = local(word) # METHOD 1 = Look through Wiktionary dumps

	if localSearch != "word not found":
		return localSearch

	parserSearch = wiki1(word) # METHOD 2 = Look through Wiktionary using JSON parser

	if parserSearch != "word not found":
		return parserSearch

	wikiSearch = wiki2(word) # METHOD 3 = Look through Wiktionary dumps for nuances like participles and singulars

	if wikiSearch != "word not found":
		return wikiSearch

	return linguee(word) # METHOD 4 = crawl through Linguee as a final recourse
```

Here is a fun table of places I've been to:

| Country | City | Local transport used |
| :-----: |:----:| :-------------------:|
| France  | Lille    | Metro, Bus       |
| France  | Paris    | Metro, Bus, Uber |
| Italy   | Rome     | Metro, Bus, Uber |
| Belgium | Brussels | Metro, Bus       |

Where have I gotten fined, for using the wrong service of transport, or not having complete documents?

`Paris`
`Brussels`

In other words, big cities suck.
