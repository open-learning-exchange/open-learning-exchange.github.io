## About Me
Hey all!
I am a recent graduate in Computer Engineering and I love application design and full-stack development. I really enjoy creating apps that people will use.
I have background in C/C++ and Python. I have taken the last year to teach myself web development and pride myself in making vibrant and interactive websites.
### My favorite language?
```typescript 
function favLanguage(): void {
  const lang: string = "TypeScript";
  console.log(lang);
}
```
### Currently Learning
```rust
pub fn currently_learning() {
    let lang: String = String::from("Rust");
    println!("{lang}");
}
```
