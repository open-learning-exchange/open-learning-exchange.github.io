## About Me
I'm a senior at **University of California, San Diego** studying **Math-Computer Science**. When I'm not at school, I'm teaching coding to K-5th graders. When I'm not doing either of those, I like tinkering with Android development and machine learning.

I also like reading comics. My favorites are:
1. Calvin and Hobbes
2. [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)
3. [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/)
4. Garfield
5. FoxTrot
6. Peanuts
