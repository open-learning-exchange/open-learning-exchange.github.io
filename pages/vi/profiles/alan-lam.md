## About Me
I'm a senior at University of California, San Diego studying Math-Computer Science. When I'm not at school, I'm teaching coding to K-5th graders. When I'm not doing either of those, I like tinkering with Android development and machine learning.

I also like reading comics. My favorites are:
* Calvin and Hobbes
* [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)
* [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/)
* Garfield
* FoxTrot
* Peanuts
