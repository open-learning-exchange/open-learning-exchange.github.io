Hi all, I am a Computer Science graduate. I was born and raised in [Suleja, Nigeria.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleja) I am a fan of Open Source Software and I believe this virtual intern opportunity will avail me with the opportunity to become more proficient in latest programming practives and to thrive in a remote development team. Another major boost is that it will avail me the opportunity to contribute in helping the less priviledged/disadvantaged communities. 
I'm also a big fan of Dan Brown's novel. I try to engaged my mind with reading when not coding.
I look forward to working with you all.
