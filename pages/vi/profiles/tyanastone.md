# About Me
I'm a recent graduate from a coding bootcamp called *General Assembly*. My strong suit is **front end development**, but I have experience and education as a full stack developer. I'm a mother of a 1 year old son, and I have another boy on the way due soon :) In my spare time I like to indulge in my hobby which is extreme couponing.
