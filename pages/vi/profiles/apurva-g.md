## Brief Introduction:

I am a graduate student at Boston University, studying Master of Science in Computer Science. I am interested in web-based application development. Before pursuing my graduate studies I  completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering. I believe myself as a quick learner. I spend my free time playing badminton, biking and reading fictional books. I like to be called as Apurva.
