Hi, everyone! I am a master student majoring in Computer Science in USC. I have experience in **Angular, Node.js, Java, Python, C++, C, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Swift, Git, SQL**. I am interested in this virtual intern because I can gain working experience and help others at the same time. I look forward working with you all!!! :smile:
