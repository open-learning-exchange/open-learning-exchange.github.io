Hello! I'm currently a senior at UC Berkeley and coding is my life  
(not quite by design, but I usually enjoy it, so I guess I can't complain).  
I'm super excited to contribute to this project!!!

Some things I love:
  * my friends
  * my family
  * my laptop
  * my bed
  * books
  * kpop / kdramas
  * manga / anime
  * webcomics
  * fanfiction / fanart
  * otome games (yes, I have no life so I must live vicariously)

Some activities I enjoy:
  * reading
  * writing (fiction)
  * knitting / sewing / DIYing
  * swimming
  * taking candid pictures of my loved ones
  * i'm sure there's more...I'm living my best life okay
