Currently, I am using a small factor HP desktop computer running _Microsoft Windows 10 Pro_.
  
## I happen to be...
Curious about new things, especially related to technology and including electronics, and the outer space.  
So, recently I began pursuing a Computer Science undergraduate degree at University of the People, and found myself now at a sort of Associate degree equivalence.  
With a few years working on IT at some companies, most of it concerned to networks. Reminding, at last, back from the 90's an awarded degree in Computer Engineering.
