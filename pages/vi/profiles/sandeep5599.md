I'm an upcoming graduate student in Computer Science with a focus on Web Development at Oklahoma City University, OK.
As an international student, I began my master's journey in August 2023 and will be graduating in May 2025.
Throughout my studies, I've gained expertise in front-end and back-end development, responsive design, JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular), database management (SQL, MongoDB), cloud computing, and API development.
My coursework and projects have helped me build a strong foundation in modern web technologies, ensuring I can develop scalable and efficient applications.
