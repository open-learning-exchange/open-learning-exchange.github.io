I'm a sophomore at Brown University studying computer science with particular interests in machine leanring, systems,
and web development. When I'm not at school, I'm in my rural New England home in western Massachusetts where I help my dad run a
maple sugar and sustainable lumber business.

My house in all its wintery glory:

In addition to personal coding projects, I've worked as a professional musician, as a dining hall manager, and as a
lifeguard. My favorite hobbies include reading, baking, playing Irish music, podcast-listening, meditation, and nerding out 
about vegan cooking.
