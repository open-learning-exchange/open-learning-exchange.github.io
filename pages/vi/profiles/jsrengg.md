### About Me
Hi Everyone! I live in Southern California and I'm currently studying for a master's in computer science. 
In my free time I like trying new restaurants, cafes, and boba shops.
I also enjoy hiking, traveling, snowboarding, and watercolors.

I think OLE has a meaningful mission and I hope I can help contribute to it during this internship.
I would also like to learn more about good development practices. 

A quote I like:
> Whatever you are, be a good one.
