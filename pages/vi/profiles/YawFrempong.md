## About Me
### Hello!
My name is Yaw Frempong and I am a undergraduate computer engineering student with an interest in computer science. I go to school in Charlotte, NC. I see this internship as an opportunity work with and learn from talented developers aswell as learn current industry software development practices. I have always loved teaching and I think giving everyone an chance to learn STEM is important. I look forward to working with everyone on the Open Learning Exchange development team to help expand open-access learning solutions.
