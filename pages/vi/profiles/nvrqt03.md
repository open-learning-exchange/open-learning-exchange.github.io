Hi everyone! My name is AJ and I am an aspiring Android developer. I am changing careers from finance, where I worked for several financial companies before deciding to get into tech. I have studied front end development for a while before deciding that I was much more interested in mobile development. In my free time I enjoy sports, cars, and spending time with my family.
