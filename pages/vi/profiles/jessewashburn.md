### About me:  

Hi! My name is Jesse. I am a software engineer living in Baltimore, MD 🇺🇸, but I am originally from Pori, Finland.  🇫🇮 

My interests are web/mobile development, data analytics, and DevOps. In my free time, I like to play classical guitar. I originally started working with OLE in October of 2024 as a **Software Engineering Intern.** and enjoyed the experience so much that I returned as a volunteer **Software Engineer Team Lead** in May of 2025. My responsibilities include developing the Planet web app, onboarding new interns, and experimenting with potential DevOps improvements, particularly new ways to incorporate AI into our workflow. Do you have a favorite AI tool you think we should use? Tell us about it!

Let's connect via [Github][2] or [LinkedIn][1]!

Cheers! 

Jesse
