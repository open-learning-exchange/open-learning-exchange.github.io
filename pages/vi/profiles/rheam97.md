# Hi Everyone

## My name is Rhea Malviya ***EST, macoS Monterey (v. 12.0.1)***

```
I was involved in interdisiciplinary social policy/social cognition research prior to switching to web development. I also previously
worked with several nonprofits in the U.S. and the EU mainly serving the needs of women refugees while I studied international development in undergrad. I am excited about my switch to software engineering
because I would like to help bring the benefits of technological advancements to those who need it most while also enjoying the creativity and collaboration that programming entails!

## A bit more about me 

* I'm currently studying full-stack web development at George Washington University and will complete my course in May.
* I binge watch horror TV shows and content from drag queens in my off time. I also like thrillers like the Ozarks. 
* I love talking about psychology, now more than ever it seems. 
* I finished studying SQL databases and Express.js servers and will be studying React and MongoDB among other things in the next 2 months! 
* I'm looking to cultivate a weekly if not daily habit of studying data structures and algorithms if anyone ever feels like practicing with me!
