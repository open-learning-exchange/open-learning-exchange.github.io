## *About Me*

I am currently a junior at the [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) majoring in computer engineering. 
If I'm not studying, I like to play tennis, read books, create things with Blender, and make cool projects with 
the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Some of my projects are on [Github](https://github.com/m516/)
