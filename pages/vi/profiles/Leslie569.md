## Who I Am 👻	
Hello everyone. I am from Mountain View, California, currently majoring in  electrical engineering at Georgia Tech. 
Although my major courses are more hardware-based, I have strong interest in programming outside of class. I am on 
[Georgia Tech's solar racing team][1] and working on server/microcontroller programming.
