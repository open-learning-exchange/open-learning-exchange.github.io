## About Me
Hi all, I am a recent coding bootcamp grad. My program was the Engineering Flex program from Thinkful. This virtual intern position is a great opportunity to not only sharpen my skills, but to be able to contribute to a collective of people that are interested in bringing quality education to people far and wide! The part that excites me most is being able to work with a team of people all interested in the same things.

## My side gig

I am a musician and I currently play several instruments and sing with a group called Utah Slim and the Desert Poets. Check out our music [here](https://www.utahslim.com/)! We sing songs about the Colorado Plateau and surrounding areas here in, you guessed it: Utah. I have been playing sax for around 16 years now, and relish the chance to perform for people. I hope to be able to make great webpages for other musicians, in addition to lending them my sound.
