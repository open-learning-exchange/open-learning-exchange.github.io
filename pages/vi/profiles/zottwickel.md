## About Me
Hi all, I am a recent coding bootcamp grad. My program was the Engineering Flex program from Thinkful. This virtual intern position is a great opportunity to not only sharpen my skills, but to be able to contribute to a collective of people that are interested in bringing quality education to people far and wide! The part that excites me most is being able to work with a team of people all interested in the same things.
