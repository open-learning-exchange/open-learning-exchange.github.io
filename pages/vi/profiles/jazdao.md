## About Me
Hello! My name is Jasmine, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the 
[California State Polytechnic University](https://www.cpp.edu/) in Pomona.
At the moment, my goals are to learn more about different technologies and to expand my web and mobile development skills.

Some of my passions include coding, music, and design.  You can find me drawing, reading, coding, and playing piano in my free time,
and according to some, I also have an unfortunate obsession with cats.

## Random Fun Facts:
  * My family once forgot the marshmallows for a camping trip and roasted mushrooms around the campfire instead.  Since then, it's
  become a tradition.  
  * From time to time, I'll pull out my ocarina and try to learn Zelda tunes.
  * My favorite video games are Nier:Automata, Undertale, and Detroit: Become Human. Common theme? Existential crises.
  * Every once in awhile, I like to indulge in my guilty pleasure of sitting down with a tub of ice-cream for dinner.
  * When I was in high school, I played the marching glockenspiel in the Drum and Bell Corps.
