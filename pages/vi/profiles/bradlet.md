## About Me:

I am a CS student at Portland State University. I'll be completing my bachelor's degree in March 2020, and then continuing towards a master's. I have a very cute dog named **CLYDE**, and he is quite literally the **best** boy.

## Skills / Projects:

I am comfortable with C++, C, Java, python, haskell, and I have a little experience with smallTalk and Ruby. Though I enjoy programming in C++ the most on my own.

I am currently working on an open-source tree data structure library for my open-source software development class. I have always loved memory management, data structures and efficient algorithms.
