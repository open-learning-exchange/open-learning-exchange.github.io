I am a senior at Pennsylvania State University World Campus and currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Information Science and Technology, with a minor in Security and Risk Analysis. I enjoy the fields of programming and information security, and I am very eager to gain more experience in a technical and creative role. My degree coursework has afforded me the opportunity to acquire programming experience with C++, Python, and Java, experience with database design, risk and threat analysis techniques, and security tools. I enjoy being part of teams, problem-solving, being creative, and working towards a greater goal.
