## Who I am

I am currently a freelance **iOS developer** as well as a **Web** **Developer** primarily using *Angular* *5* and learning to expand on my
skills with the **MEAN** **stack**. I write iOS software natively in **Swift** and learned coding with *Java* in college.

## Outside of coding

Outside of writing software, I spend a lot of time writing music with **Ableton** **Live** and have been producing/DJing for roughly 7 years.
I am self taught in regards of web development, as all my formal experience has been with backend development.
In my free time I'm either at the *gym* or *traveling* to *snowboard*.

### Where to find me

You can see some of my existing work on my [Portfolio](http://phillstack.com/) and previous coding samples on my [Github](http://www.github.com/mphill05).
