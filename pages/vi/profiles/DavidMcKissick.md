## About me

Hey, I'm a long time computer-lover that originally started in system repair (All hail PEBCAK) but ultimately came into programming
work in a softcore way in the early 2010s or so. After a bit of time I received a Google Udacity Scholarship in frontend 
development and my slight interest became a full blown fascination! I have a strong interest in non-profits and the open source 
movement. I decided I wanted to work with the OLE as I believe in the mission and I believe it would be a good way to grow my skills
in an environment I believe in.

## Skillset
As of right now, my skillset is relatively short but I am always learning, for now here are some strong points.

* Javascript
* CSS with and without frameworks (E.G. Sass)
* HTML(5) incl. Canvas
* React, angular 
* Python (To a lesser degree, still learning)

As well as these, I'm currently learning Rust and, as said above, python.

### *My favorite quote would have to be:* 
>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. - Rick cook, 1989
