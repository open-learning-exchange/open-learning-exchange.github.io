Hello my name is Zion. I recently graduated in California State University Chico with Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems. I am looking for internships about software enginnering. Recenly, I create a mobile app called [HungryStomach](https://github.com/zionnoizy/HungryStomach). This is an android food order system app using Firebase, Java, and Braintree api. In my spare time, I like to install diffrent kinds of OS (ubuntu, windows10, windows7 etc..) in my virtual box. Recently, I install galliumOS on my new chromebook and the styling of galliumOS is great.
