## About Me
Hello, I am a Computer Science major graduating in the Spring of 2018.  
My favorite programming langauges to code in are as follows:

   * Android

   * jQuery

5. Last and definitely least, PHP  


My most recent personal project is an Android app called What's for Dinner?  
It works by using the Google Maps API to locate your device and then  
uses the Google Web Services API to find restaurants near you.  
Finally, it selects one for you at random.
