__Short Bio:__ Hello everyone, I am John Drake, a 5th year computer Science Student at the University of Oregon set to graduate this 
summer. This Virtual Intern position will also help me fulfill those graduation requirements, so I'm very happy to be here.
I will be working from Arlington, Texas, not in Oregon, however :)
