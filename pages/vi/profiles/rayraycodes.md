## About Me
Hello everyone, I am Regan from Kathmandu, Nepal. I love talking about technology, chatting about interesting stories in your lives, run long distances, write my experiences, and pushing my mindset.

I am also pursuing a Master of Science in Computer and Information Science at the University of Michigan.

Previously, I was a Lead Software Developer at Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal. I led a team of six game designers and developers to create learning games for children in rural areas in collaboration with MIT Nepal Initiative. I also contributed to developing EPaath, an interactive content platform that delivered more than 200 learning modules to thousands of students. My goal is to create meaningful solutions that enhance learning outcomes and experiences for diverse learners, starting January 2024.
