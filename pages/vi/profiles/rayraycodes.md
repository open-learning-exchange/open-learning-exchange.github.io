## About Me
Hello everyone, I am Regan from Kathmandu, Nepal. I love talking about technology, chatting about interesting stories in life, running long distances, writing about my experiences, and pushing my mindset.

Previously, I was a Lead Software Developer at Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal. I led a team of six game designers and developers to create learning games for children. I also contributed to developing EPaath, an interactive content platform that delivered more than 200 learning modules to thousands of students. I am looking forward to my OLE journey.
