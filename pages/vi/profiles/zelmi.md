I spend my free time volunteering to teach young kids and adults about science! I love teaching and I love coding as well, and an opportunity to work with the OLE team would let me share my knowledge and gain more experience as well.

My current area of expertise is in **Java development**, **web development** in HTML and CSS, and general **software testing**.

I look forward to learning much more with OLE as I do my best to give back as well.
