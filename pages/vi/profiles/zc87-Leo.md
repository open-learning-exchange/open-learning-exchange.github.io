## About Me
Hi all, I'm a recent computer science graduate. I was born and raised in [Shanghai, China] and came to Boston for my graduate study. I believe this virtual intern opportunity would be a great chance for me to become more proficient in latest programming practices and to thrive in a team environment. In the mean time, I could give back and help disadvantaged communities. I look forward working with you all.
