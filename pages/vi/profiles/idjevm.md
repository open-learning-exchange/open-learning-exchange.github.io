## About Me
Hello everyone, I am JV, a college student/software engineer from Boston MA. I was born here but raised in the middle of the mountains near [El Pital, El Salvador](https://www.google.com/search?q=el+pital+el+salvador&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS867US867&sxsrf=ACYBGNT-f4D9vLEmvfu44jZHasFr6Cu_9A:1573117785531&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim_a624NflAhXxTN8KHer4AvsQ_AUIEigB&biw=1920&bih=946) and came back to Boston when I was 17. I have been since then mostly learning spoken and programming languages and slowly trying to break into the industry. Given the fact that I come from a community college, and Latinx, it is really hard to break into the industry so I have been teaching myself a lot of new stuff to keep improving. Currenlty I am interning at a startup based in Colorado where I get to learn more about common best practices for interviews and conduct tech interviews myself. I work part-time and remotely so I have lots of free time to give to this community. 

I believe this virtual intern opportunity would be a great chance for me to learn new methodologies and show my work. Working with the OLE team would be beneficial to help me achieve my goals to give back to the community. 

I look forward working with all of you!
