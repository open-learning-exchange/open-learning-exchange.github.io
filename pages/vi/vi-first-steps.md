# First Steps – Software Engineering Virtual Intern

## The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming an OLE Software Engineering Virtual Intern! We treat these first steps as a vetting process to prove that you can follow simple instructions before you can progress to working on harder projects in bigger teams. Consider them to be the interview for the internship.

If you are selected for the internship after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the OLE software engineering interns team! We’ll add you to relevant Discord channels and assign you to a specific team to work on developing and improving OLE’s software. Our current project is **[Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet) – a learning management system designed as a Progressive Web App using Angular and CouchDB.** [Click here](https://www.ole.org/our-platform) to learn more about the Planet Learning platform.

During this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with various software, tools, and technologies, including **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**, **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)**, **[Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)**, **[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)**, **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**, **[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)**, **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)**, **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**, **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**, **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**, **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)**, and **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.

**NOTE**: This is an unpaid, intensive internship requiring a minimum commitment of 24 hours per week for at least 3 months. Additional details about the internship can be found in our [FAQ](vi-faq.md#General_Internship_Questions).

## The Steps

Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and Open Learning Exchange (OLE) is no different. Throughout the following steps, you will learn Markdown, Docker, Git, GitHub (issues, pull requests, etc.), and OLE's learning management system (LMS) – [Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet).

* **Expectations & Quality**
    * **High Quality Work:** These steps may appear simple, but we expect high-quality work which might require extra time. Just passively following the steps is the bare minimum; instead, aim to impress us with excellent github etiquette and well-structured Markdown.
    * **Learning:** We want to see that you can use or learn to use these tools effectively, i.e., writing clear github issues, using basic git commands, creating proper pull requests, navigating Planet, etc.
    * **Deepen Understanding:** Treat these steps as learning opportunities. The skills you practice in first steps are crucial for this internship as well as a future career in software development.

* **Continuous Improvement**
    * **Wiki Feedback:** A significant part of this process is identifying problems or suggesting improvements for this MDwiki.
    * **Documentation:** Take note of any issues or enhancement ideas you encounter to help us improve these steps for future interns.

* **Communication & Updates**
    * **Regular Reporting:** You are required to keep us regularly updated in our Discord server's **#vi-software** channel.
    * **Progress:** We will ask you to send messages, links, and screenshots to track your progress. Do not miss this step, as it is vital for us to track your work.

* **Resources & Timeline**
    * **Deadlines:** While there is no official deadline, most successful candidates complete these steps within **7–8 days**.
    * **Support:** The MDwiki offers multiple resources to assist you with useful links at the end of each step. Good Luck!

## Step 0 - Introductory Steps
**(Estimated Time: 1h)**

Follow the instructions on [Virtual Software Interns Introductory Step](vi-intro-step.md).

## Step 1 - GitHub, Markdown, and Forking Workflow
**(Estimated Time: 1.5h)**

Follow the instructions on the [GitHub, Markdown, and Forking Workflow page](vi-github-and-markdown.md).

- Once you complete this step, you will have:
  - 1 Pull request made

Make sure that you've linked to your github.io and pull request link in [#vi-software channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1079980988421132369/1229437557843169280) (`https://YourUserName.github.io` and `LinkToYourPullRequest`). Also include the Raw.githack link in your pull request as we asked in the pull request template.

## Step 2 - Software Prerequisites
**(Estimated Time: 1.5h)**

Setting up your local development environment is the first step to becoming a Virtual Intern at OLE. Follow the instructions on the [Environment Setup](vi-prerequisites.md) to install the necessary tools and software. This will prepare you to successfully run both production and development versions of the planet later on.

## Step 3 - Planet and Docker
**(Estimated Time: 2.5h)**

This step includes two tasks:

1. **Docker Tutorial:**
   - Follow the instructions on the [Docker Tutorial page](vi-docker-tutorial.md).
   - Docker is a program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as containerization.
   - Learn the basics of interacting with Docker and Docker Compose using the command-line interface and basic commands for maintaining your Planet installation.

2. **Planet Configurations:**
   - Refer to the [Planet Configurations page](vi-planet-configurations.md).
   - Learn how to configure your Community Planet.

## Step 4 - Planet and myPlanet Tutorial
**(Estimated Time: 2h)**

This step includes the [Planet Tutorial](vi-planetapps.md), which explains the features of the Planet application.

Additionally, there is a [myPlanet Tutorial](vi-myplanet.md) that covers the Android application. Please follow this tutorial if you have an Android device.

## Step 5 - Keeping Fork Updated
**(Estimated Time: 1h)**

Follow the directions at [Git Repositories](vi-github-and-repositories.md) to keep your username.github.io and your local repository up to date.

## Step 6 - GitHub Issues Tutorial
**(Estimated Time: 2.5h)**

Follow the direction at [GitHub Issues](vi-github-issues.md). In this step, you’ll learn about GitHub Issues, Commits, and Pull Requests, as well as the collaborative workflow used during the internship. You will create a GitHub Issue related to the Software Engineering Intern First Steps’ content, create a branch to address it, and submit a Pull Request to the `open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io` repository. Additionally, you’ll collaborate with the team to make necessary changes and comment on existing Issues.

Please note that creating and working on issues is not strictly bound by the specific "Step" you're in. You may continue working up to Step 9 while awaiting OLE approval for your issue(s) or pull request(s).

## Step 7 - Nation Planet
**(Estimated Time: 2h)**

Follow the directions under the [Nation Planet tab](vi-nation.md).

## Step 8 - Create More Issues and Pull Requests
**(Estimated Time: 4.5h)**

Follow [Create More Issues and Pull Requests](vi-create-issues-and-pull-requests.md), where you'll focus on improving our Markdown Wiki. This involves creating three issues, with at least one addressing content reduction and another enhancing the Planet User Manual. Additionally, you'll comment on three existing issues and resolve your own by submitting pull requests. Follow the process outlined in the [GitHub Issues Tutorial](vi-github-issues.md), each pull request will need to be reviewed and approved by two team members before merging.

**Hint**: You can track your progress with the number of pull requests and issues [here](../track-first-steps-progress.md).

## Step 9 - Planet Development Setup
**(Estimated Time: 3h)**

In Step 2, we set up a local production environment for Planet. Now, follow the [Planet Development Setup Tutorial](vi-docker-development-tutorial.md) to configure your development environment. This step involves working with Docker, Git, Node.js, Angular, and the Planet application.

## Step 10 - Be Part of the Team
**(Estimated Time: 1h)**

Once you've confirmed that you've met the requirements in the [progress tracker](../track-first-steps-progress.md), your next step is to add yourself to the virtual intern list in [vi-team.md](vi-team.md) and submit a pull request. Afterward, message us ("@mutugiii", "@dogi", and "@vi-software") in the Discord [*#vi-software*](https://discord.com/channels/1079980988421132369/1229437557843169280) channel to schedule a meeting and officially join the team.

After scheduling the meeting, and before it takes place, be sure to review the [Software Engineering Intern Orientation document](vi-intern-orientation.md).
