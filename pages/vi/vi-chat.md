# open-learning-exchange / chat

## Discord

Our **Discord** server is a great place to learn, discuss, and collaborate with other members to build a better Open Learning Exchange platform. The chat lets OLE’s development team and interns communicate easily, and signup is through each member’s GitHub account.

Communication is key in every collaborative project, and OLE is no different.

## Best Practices

As you complete the [Virtual Intern First Steps](vi-first-steps.md) aornd the [Mobile Intern First Steps](pages/mi/mi-10-steps.md), we want you to keep us updated in the discord server. Generally, you should comment in the chat when you make an issue or pull request, and then link to it. Make a mention (@*name*) of someone when you comment on their issue/pull request, then link to it. For example:

> @ssamikshaa, I just commented on your issue: <https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io/issues/3459#issuecomment-2433505911>

This good etiquette helps streamline communication between internship candidates and staff members alike! Feel free to look through the chat for more examples.

You may want to include clarifying *images* with your messages. To add an image in the chat, either drag and drop or copy and paste it into the messaging area.
