# Be part of the team (Step 9)

## Objectives

* Sync your community with the nation
* Add yourself to the virtual intern list
* Read the intern orientation document

## Introduction

Now that you have finished step 8, sync your community with the nation (as you did in Step 7 - [Nation Planet tab](vi-nation.md)).

Next thing is to add yourself to the virtual intern list found in [vi-team.md](vi-team.md) and create a pull request. Message us ("@/all" and "@dogi") in the Gitter chat room so that we can set up a meeting and add you to the team as soon as possible.

Make sure to read through the [intern orientation document](#!./pages/robots/rbts-intern-orientation.md) before the meeting.

#### Successfully completed all the first steps!!!.
