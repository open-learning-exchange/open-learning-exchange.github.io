## About Me
Hi all, I'm, Xinyu Liang, a candidate for Master Degree in Information system.  As for me, the virtual intern is a brand new thing, which can let me learn a lot from it. For example,  I can learn to work with a thriving team in a true work environment. And I can also be a 
participant of welfare to break the barrier of learning.
