## Watch the Organization and Follow Contributors

In GitHub, we [follow organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-organizations) and [follow people](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-people) to receive notifications about their activity. Look for the "Watch" button at the top right of the page when you are in a repository. Additionally, follow each other to stay updated on what others in the group are working on.

- Use the "Watch" button in repositories you're working on and "Follow" individuals to keep up with the latest activities.
- Follow the [Open Learning Exchange
](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange) to stay updated on changes with OLE on GitHub.
- Watch the [Open Learning Exchange's Planet repository](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet) to stay updated on changes with the main repository you'll be working on.
- Follow OLE's CTO [dogi](https://github.com/dogi) and Planet's core developer [Mutugi](https://github.com/Mutugiii) on GitHub.
- You can also follow [other active mobile interns](vi-team.md) to stay updated on their activities.

## Contribute to Translations on Crowdin
- We use Crowdin to translate our user interface into multiple languages.
- If you know [a language supported by Planet](https://crowdin.com/project/ole-planet), your translation assistance would be greatly appreciated. Create a Crowdin account and aim to translate at least 10% of the words in your chosen language. For an overview of the functionality and terminology, refer to the [Planet User Manual](#!./pages/techgenius/tg-planet-user-manual.md). Your contributions will help both the project and enhance your understanding of Planet.
