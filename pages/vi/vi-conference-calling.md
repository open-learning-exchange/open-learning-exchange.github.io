# OLE Conference Calling

OLE uses conference calling to manage a variety of support and development needs. Our primary use of conference calling is for technical support. We find that direct, face-to-face and voice calling provides the necessary inputs to effectively support field implementation.

## Etiquette

When you contact OLE via one of our support channels we ask that you pay close attention to the following guidelines:

1. **Recognize that this is a shared space that is used by many people including developers, users, and supporters.** Therefore, when you first enter a conference call or chat channel please note that others may be on the line before you and that conversations are very likely ongoing. Please do not interrupt an ongoing conversation until there is a natural break in the conversation or until you are addressed by the moderator.

2. **Recognize that video consumes bandwidth.** Please turn off your video before you enter the room. Although bandwidth may not be an issue for you, it often is in remote parts of the world where many of OLE partners are located.

3. **Recognize that background noise often cause issues**, especially when there a number of people are on the same channel. **Please mute your microphone when you are not talking.**
