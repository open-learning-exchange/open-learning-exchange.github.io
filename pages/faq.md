# FAQ

## General Internship Information
*Q: What will I be working on during this internship?*
OLE virtual interns will be helping develop OLE’s BeLL (Basic e-Learning Library) software. The BeLL is a virtual library that is deployed internationally to children in countries that typically do not have access to educational resources. 

*Q: What kind of software will we be using for this internship?*
As a part of this internship you will be working with software and languages including Git, GitHub, Gitter, Markdown, Vagrant, VirtualBox, Command Line/Terminal, Command Line/Terminal Scripts, Vim, CouchDB, Docker, HTML5, Javascript, and Node.js.

*Q: Where can I find more information about this internship?*
More information about the internship can be found here: http://www.internships.com/computer-science/virtual-software-engineer-intern-i4794997

*Q: What are the hours of the internship?*
This is an intensive internship that requires 15 hours of work each week. Work with your fellow interns and keep us updated in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat).

*Q: What happens after the initial steps?*
The initial 5 steps are meant to introduce potential interns to the OLE BeLL software and the process that we use to develop features and improve upon the BeLL. To be more clear: the initial 5 steps are a vetting process to determine whether or not people are fit for the internship, so consider it an interview for the internship. Once you have completed the 5 steps and are approved, you have officially joined the OLE interns team! We’ll add you to the interns Gitter chatroom and assign you to a team. You and your team will be working on an assignment, and we’ll switch up the assignments each week. 

*Q: If I'm an international student, how soon can I get my paperwork required by my visa?*
After you finish the first 5 steps, let us know if you need us to sign some paperwork or provide you with an offer letter for your visa. Since the first 5 steps are a vetting process, your internship technically doesn't start until you finish them. Think of the first 5 steps as a continued application process as you are not working or adding to our organizational software, but rather showing that you have enough technical background to work with us. We are more than happy to speak to you about providing you with an offer letter or assisting with organizational information once you complete the 5 steps, but as you are not working with us until you are officially an intern, we cannot provide proof of working with us until you compete the first steps. 


## Technical Issues and Questions
*Q: How can I enable the Virtualization in order to turn vagrant on?*
First of all, you have to access the BIOS. To do that, you need to reboot your computer and press the appropriate key while it’s booting. It is usually the "F2" or "Delete" key. Once you have entered the BIOS setup menu, you have to search for an option called "Intel VT-x", "Intel Virtualization Technology" or something similar. Enable this option, save and reset. Now the "vagrant up" command should be working fine.
