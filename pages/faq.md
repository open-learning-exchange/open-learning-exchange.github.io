Q: What happens after the initial steps?
The initial 5 steps are meant to introduce potential interns to the OLE BeLL software and the process that we use to develop features and improve upon the BeLL. Once you have completed the 5 steps and are approved, you have officially joined the OLE interns team! We’ll add you to the interns gitter chatroom and assign you to a team. You and your team will be working on an assignment, and we’ll switch up the assignments each week.
