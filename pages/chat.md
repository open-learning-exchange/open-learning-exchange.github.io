# open-learning-exchange/chat

Our **Gitter** chat, previewed below, is a great place to learn, discuss, and collaborate with other members to build a better Open Learning Exchange platform. The chat lets OLE’s development team and interns communicate easily, and signup is simply through each member’s Github account.

Communication is key in every collaborative project, and OLE is no different. Gitter provides tight integration with *Github* and provides full rich text support through **Markdown**, an important tool for clean, efficient communication. Combining these features allows members to mention other members in a message, format text, share images and code, and directly link to Github issues and repositories.

As you complete the [First Steps](http://open-learning-exchange.github.io/#!pages/firststeps.md), we want you to keep us updated a relatively good amount in the Gitter chat. Generally, you should comment in the Gitter chat when you make an issue or pull request, and then link to it. Make a mention (@*name*) of someone when you comment on their issue/pull request, then link to it.
For example:
  "Hey @dogi, just commented on your issue: [https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io/issues/15](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io/issues/15)
  
This good etiquette helps streamline communication between internship candidates and staff members alike! Feel free to look through the chat for more examples.
