# open-learning-exchange/chat

Our **Gitter** chat, previewed below, is a great place to learn, discuss, and collaborate with other members to build a better Open Learning Exchange platform. The chat lets OLE’s development team and interns communicate easily, and signup is simply through each member’s Github account.

Communication is key in every collaborative project, and OLE is no different. Gitter provides tight integration with *Github issues and repositories*, as well as support for *Trello, Jenkins, Travis,* and many other services. It also has full rich text support through **Markdown**, an important tool for clean, efficient communication.
