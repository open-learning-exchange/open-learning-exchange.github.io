#Project Title : Simple Install

##Objective 
Creating Installation processes for diffrent OS like Linux, MAC and Windows and Working on issues at https://github.com/dogi/ole--vagrant-community/issues

##Documentation

##Prerequisites
* Fork ole--vagrant-community again.
* Check out your system RAM as Multiple machines are running at same time.
* Check  out status of machine via 'vagrant global-status'.
* Remember to use our `git clone`like at the beginning on MDwiki.
* Fork and create a vagrant on your machine. Use 127.0.0.1:5984. Sync to vi again and use your same login. 
* Visit and research http://brew.sh/ for learning more about installation script.

##Batch Programming
In this project we are working on Batch programming. It is a command line script which runs commands and execute it in sequence.Here we have to create such a script as .Bat file which runs commands and complete installation process.

###Creating .bat file
* You can create .bat file by addding some commands in any editor like notpad or notepad++.
* Save file with .bat extension.It will create executable file
* you need to learn and research different DOS commands which help us to simplifies the process of installation and achieve our objective. 

###Script should perform following functionality:
* Auto install vagrant
* Auto install virtualbox
* Turn the machine on
* Add a shortcut to desktop
* Finish

##Why we need Script?

* Setting up any new environment requires to find,Download and install diffrent softwares.
* To install diffrent softwares and related components saperately is time consuming process.
* It also arises the complexity overall if software have compatibility issues or dependancies.
* Hence to automate the process of installation by runnning single script is easiest way to avoid such overhead. 
* You do not need to install softwares saperately for settig up environment and script will install all software at once.
In privious steps we need to install vagrant, virtualbox saperately. This script will simplifies the process and helps to configure Bell app.

##About Homebrew
* Homebrew simplifies the process of downloading,compiling and installing softwares using simple script. 
* It is bulk installer and command line utility script which automate the process of installation on OS X operating system . 
* Homebrew is package manager which implemented in ruby language. You can research more about it by visiting http://brew.sh/ link.
