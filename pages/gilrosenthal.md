>I am Gil Rosenthal, currently a sophomore at Roxbury Latin in Boston.
I started programming in 7th grade and haven't looked back since! 
I started off learning C#, then moved to Javascript, then to Java and am currently learning Python!
I love giving back to the community and using my talents for good, and I think OLE is the perfect way to do that!
