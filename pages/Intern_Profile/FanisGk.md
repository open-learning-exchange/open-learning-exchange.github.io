I am Fanis, an ambitious Computer Science and Engineering student who studies at University of Ioannina. 
I am very satisfied with picking this type of carreer and I am really into it. 
Unfortunately, I don't have much work experience yet but my willingness to learn new things and gain more experience is huge. 
I believe that my biggest advantage is that I am always very dedicated to what I am doing and this is what helps me to accomplish my goals.
