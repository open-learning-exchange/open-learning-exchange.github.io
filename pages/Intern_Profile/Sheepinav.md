Hello! My name is Abhinav and I am currently a Freshman at UC Berkeley majoring in Molecular and Cellular Biology and Statistics, 
with a minor in Computer Science. I'm also attempting to learn Korean. I'm originally from Minnesota, and I enjoy sleeping a lot.
I look forward to working with everyone!
