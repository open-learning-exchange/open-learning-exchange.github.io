> Hi! My name is Chris, and I am a computer science student at the City College of New York. I grew up in the Philippines and moved to New York 5 years ago. I have been interested in computers ever since I was little. I discovered programming when I was in high school, and I foresaw myself doing it in the future. Right now, I am learning C++, Android app development, and web development.
