>I am Ishan Soni, currently a sophomore at the Stony Brook University majoring in computer science.
I first started programming back in high school and ever since have been passionate about learning more and more of it.
In my free time, I usually do something coding related like making mobile apps, websites, practice technical interview
questions or learn about new technologies. I am very excited to start interning at OLE and working with you guys!
