# Translation Support	

Welcome to the translation support section. We appreciate any and all translation support. Thank you for your interest in our software!

## The Big Picture

Planet Learning is a virtual library and student management portal that is deployed internationally to support content and opportunity distribution.

As a means of communication we encourage you to subscribe to the [General Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mtgGD4EnYW).

## Crowdin

OLE uses crowdin to manage our software translations. We have found crowdin to be very friendly to the open source community. Moreover, crowdin offers a number of integration tools that fit our workflow. We are grateful for their support.
