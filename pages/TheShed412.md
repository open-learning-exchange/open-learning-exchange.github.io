Hey! I am currently a Junior at the University of Pittsburgh. I originally went to a Community College for two years before transferring 
to Pitt last Spring. I use to bowl, play lacrosse, and play baseball. I also played drums through high school so I have a residual knack
for music. I have worked a bit in education. I was an online instructor at a site called coding4youth. I volunteered at a daycare and
showed kids how to use Raspberry Pi's. I also have tutored a lot in things like programming to maths and physics. I am pretty excited
to contribute to an organization like this!
