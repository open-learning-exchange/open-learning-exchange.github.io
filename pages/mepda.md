<h4><hr> Greetings! I am a <em>Freshman</em> studying <em>Computer Science</em>. I've taken courses in Java, Python, SQL and Database design. In the past year or so I've also picked up some web design and have used HTML/CSS and Javascript. My primary computer is a PC and my laptop is a MacBook.
I'm passionate about:


<li><ul>Technology in all it's forms</ul></li>
<li><ul>Learning new things</ul></li>
<li><ul>Teaching and improving my craft</ul></li>
<li><ul>Social Equality</ul></li>

On occasion, I like to write about my learning / life experiences in my <a href="https://smittyanddrweston.wordpress.com/"> blog </a>. I look forward to working with everyone and helping to bring education to people around the globe!</h4>
