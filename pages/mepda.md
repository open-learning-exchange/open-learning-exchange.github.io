<h6>Greetings! I am a Freshman at the University of the People currently Studying Computer Science. I'm still rather green, but I'm very happy
to have learned so much in the past year, and am eager to learn more! In my free time, I like reading books and playing board games. So
far I've just scratched the surface of Computer Science, but can already see how it's a great lens to view the world and solve problems
with. On occasion, I like to write about my learning / life experiences in my <a href="https://smittyanddrweston.wordpress.com/"> blog </a>. I look forward to working with everyone!</h6>
