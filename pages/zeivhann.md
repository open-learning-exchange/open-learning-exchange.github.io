>My name is [Alex Silcott](https://www.github.com/zeivhann), I am a student at Wright State University where I study Computer Science. I love writing code, solving problems, and learning about the world we live in. I'm very excited for the opportunity to work with the [Open Learning Exchange](http://www.ole.org) and hope to expand my knowledge of git and working as a team on open source projects. I am an avid reader, gamer, and music enthusiast. I'm currently teaching myself to play the piano and spending too much time in record stores digging through crates of vinyl.
