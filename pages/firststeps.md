# First Steps

# The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming an OLE Virtual Intern! We treat these first steps as a vetting process to prove that you can follow simple instructions before you can progress to working on harder projects in bigger teams. Consider them to be the interview for the internship. 

If you are selected for the internship after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the OLE interns team! We’ll add you to the interns Gitter chatroom and assign you to a specific team to work on developing and improving OLE’s BeLL (Basic e-Learning Library) software. The BeLL is a virtual library that is deployed internationally to individuals in countries that typically do not have access to educational resources.

Once accepted, you and your team will work on an assignment, and we’ll switch up the assignments each week. As part of this internship, you will be working with software and languages including Git, GitHub, Gitter, Markdown, Vagrant, VirtualBox, Command Line/Terminal, Command Line/Terminal Scripts, Vim, CouchDB, Docker, HTML5, Javascript, and Node.js.

**Note:** *This is an unpaid but intensive internship that requires 16 hours of work each week. More information about the internship can be found [here](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=%22virtual+software+engineer+intern%22&l=Cambridge,+MA). If you have further questions, don’t hesitate to ask other members in the Gitter [chat](http://open-learning-exchange.github.io/#!pages/chat.md)!*

# The Steps

Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and the Open Learning Exchange is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about the Github team workflow, including git, forking, pull requests, and repository issues. You will also be introduced to Markdown’s rich text formatting and OLE’s Basic e-Learning Library (BeLL), the digital library that hosts the learning materials.

Because these steps are simple, we expect high quality work, which may take a longer time. We want to see that you are capable of using or learning how to use these tools (writing good GitHub issues, creating pull requests, navigating the BeLL, etc.). These steps may seem easy, but we want you to impress us with good GitHub etiquette and quality Markdown. The bare minimum would be to just passively follow the steps; you should do further reading about the tools/languages we use so you can further your understanding and relieve confusion if you're unclear about how something works. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!** The Github and Markdown skills you practice here are very important in both this internship and a future software development career.

The MD wiki has plenty of resources to help you complete the steps. There is a list of useful links at the end of each step and we created a [FAQ page](http://open-learning-exchange.github.io/#!./pages/faq.md) where you can find the answers to some commonly asked questions. This page has even more useful links and video tutorials that will help you become familiar with the tools/languages we use. For anything that is not in the FAQ page, Google and Stack Exchange are your friends :)

We also want you to keep us updated a relatively good amount in the Gitter chat as you complete these steps. Please check our [Gitter chat](http://open-learning-exchange.github.io/#!pages/chat.md) page for more information about how to best communicate in Gitter.

A very large part of these steps is finding problems with these steps and this MD wiki, so take note of any issues that you run into or suggestions for improvement while doing these steps. Think of it as improving these steps and this MD wiki for future interns. 

There is no official deadline to complete these steps, but most candidates who are approved for the internship program finished the steps within 7-8 days. Good luck!


##Step #0: Introductory Steps:
1. Please send us your resume again (along with a short description of yourself and what you would like to be called) to vi@ole.org.
2. Watch [Open Learning Exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io) and Follow [Emily](https://github.com/EmilyLarkin), [Stuart](https://github.com/sente) and [Dogi](https://github.com/dogi) on GitHub. In GitHub we "Watch" organization repositories and "Follow" individuals. When you are on a repository or profile page, look for these buttons in the top right of the screen. Please also follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.
3. We use Crowdin to translate our user interface in many different languages. If you know another language, please go to [this Crowdin link](https://crowdin.com/project/open-learning-exchange/invite) to join Crowdin by creating an account. It would be very helpful for you to translate some of the words and familiarize yourself with the software. It would be great to get at least 10% on a language that you speak. If you want to spend additional time, feel free to provide translations to 100%.

##Step #1: BeLL Installation:
Go to [this GitHub address](https://github.com/dogi/ole--vagrant-vi) to read through the basic instructions on how to create your own digital library (what we call the BeLL, or Basic e-Learning Library). You can either scroll down to see the instructions or you can also find them in the README.md file. Please, do not make ANY changes to the text or files: simply read and follow the directions for your operating system.

##Step #2: Vagrant Tutorial:
####Windows 
Please, review these [Vagrant instructions](vagrantwin.md) to get familiar with Vagrant, since you will need to use it during your internship.
####MacOS(X) and Ubuntu
Please, review these [Vagrant instructions](vagrant.md) to ensure that you have fully completed the previous step.

##Step #3: Markdown and Fork Tutorial:
Follow the instructions on the [GitHub and Markdown page](githubandmarkdown.md). Make sure that you've linked to your github.io and your personal .md page on the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat) (&lt;username&gt;.github.io and &lt;username&gt;.github.io/#!pages/&lt;username&gt;.md).

##Step #4: BeLL-Apps Tutorial:
Follow the instructions under the [BeLL-Apps tab](bellapps.md).

##Step #5: Keeping Fork Updated:
Follow the directions at [Git Repositories](gitandrepositories.md) to keep your username.github.io and your local repository up to date.

##Step #6: GitHub Issues Tutorial:
Complete the tutorial under the [GitHub Issues tab](githubissues.md) and make sure to keep us posted in the Gitter chat. You should link in Gitter whenever you create an issue or when you comment on someone else's issue. Please post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as personal practice. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. Next, fix the issue on your repo and create pull requests. Don't forget you can also comment and work on issues that you didn't create. The more you work and commit and push, the more impressive your GitHub profile will become. This is very important to potential employers, thus we encourage you to spend time to increase your numbers to strengthen your profile.

##Step #7: Nation BeLL:
Follow the directions under the [Nation BeLL tab](nation.md).

##Step #8: Create Issues and Pull Requests:
Please create three issues, add comments to three other issues, and resolve three issues by making the necessary changes in your repo with three separate pull requests. You will follow the same steps as in [GitHub Issues](githubissues.md), but will be working to improve this Markdown Wiki so that it is clearer and better for future use. As you have now followed along with the Markdown Wiki thus far, you should all try to improve the clarity of the explanations for these steps. Learn by teaching - or editing our teaching tool, in this case! When you are fixing an issue, please mention the number of the issue you are fixing in the description of your pull request.

##Step #9: Submit Survey:
Let us know in the Gitter chat when you're done, so we can send the survey to your community. Then, fill out the survey and submit it. Next, Sync your community with the nation (as you did in step 7). Lastly, once you have completed all other steps, please add yourself to the virtual intern list found in team.md and create a pull request.
