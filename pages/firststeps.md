# First Steps

Welcome to the first steps for becoming an OLE Virtual Intern! We treat these first steps as a vetting process to prove that you can follow simple steps before you can progress to working on harder projects in bigger teams. Because these steps are simple, we expect high quality work, which may take a longer time. We want to see that you are capable of using or learning how to use these tools (writing good GitHub issues, creating pull requests, navigating the BeLL, etc.). These steps may seem easy, but we want you to impress us with good GitHub etiquette and quality Markdown. The bare minimum would be to just passively follow the steps; you should do further reading about the tools/languages we use so you can further your understanding and relieve confusion if you're unclear about how something works. Google and Stack Exchange are your friends :) 

We also want you to keep us updated a relatively good amount in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat) as you complete these steps. Generally, you should comment in the Gitter chat when you make an issue or pull request, and then link to it. It's also good form to mention someone in Gitter when you comment on their issue/pull request, and of course link to it. For example: "Hey @EmilyLarkin, just commented on your issue: https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io/issues/15"

A very large part of these steps is finding problems with these steps and this MD wiki, so **make sure to take note of any issues that you run into or suggestions for improvement while doing these steps**. Think of it as improving these steps and this MD wiki for future interns. Good luck!

###Step #0: Introductory Steps:
1. Please send us your resume again (along with a short description of yourself and what you would like to be called) to vi@ole.org. 
2. Watch [Open Learning Exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io) and Follow [Emily](https://github.com/EmilyLarkin) and [Dogi](https://github.com/dogi) on GitHub. In GitHub we "Watch" organizations and "Follow" individuals. When you are on a repository or profile page, look for these buttons in the top right of the screen. Please also follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.
3. We use Crowdin to translate our user interface in many different languages. If you know another langauge, please go to [this Crowdin link](https://crowdin.com/project/open-learning-exchange/invite) to join Crowdin by creating an account. It would be very helpful for you to translate some of the words and familiarize yourself with the software. It would be great to get at least 10% on a language that you speak. If you want to spend additional time, feel free to provide translations to 100%.

###Step #1: BeLL Installation:
Go to [this GitHub address](https://github.com/dogi/ole--vagrant-bells) to read through the basic instructions on how to create your own digital library (what we call the BeLL, or Basic e-Learning Library). It involves several steps of downloading various content to your OS so that you can use and work within our software. You should be able to scroll down to see ole--vagrant-bells, but you can also find it in the README.md file. Please do not make ANY changes to the text or files: simply read and follow the directions.

###Step #2: Vagrant Tutorial:
Review [Vagrant instructions](vagrant.md) to ensure that you have completed the last step fully. 

###Step #3: Markdown and Fork Tutorial:
Follow the instructions on the [GitHub and Markdown page](githubandmarkdown.md). Make sure that you've linked to your github.io and your personal .md page on the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat) (&lt;username&gt;.github.io and &lt;username&gt;.github.io/pages/&lt;username&gt;.md.).

###Step #4: BeLL-Apps Tutorial:
Follow the instructions under the [BeLL-Apps tab](bellapps.md). Once you give us a screenshot of your configurations, we'll let you know when they are hooked up to the VI nation so you can sync your community with the nation.

###Step #5: GitHub Issues Tutorial:
Complete the tutorial under the [GitHub Issues tab](githubissues.md) and be sure to keep us posted in the Gitter chat. You should link in Gitter whenever you create an issue or when you comment on someone else's issue. Please post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as personal practice. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. Following, do and create pull requests. Don't forget you can also comment and work on issues that you didn't create. The more you work and commit and push, the more impressive your GitHub profile is. This is very important to potential employers so we encourage you to spend time to increase your numbers so that your profile is strengthened.

###Steps #6: Keeping Fork Updated:
Follow the directions for keeping your username.github.io and your local repository up to date on [Git Repositories](gitandrepositories.md).

###Step #7: Nation BeLL:
Follow the directions under the [Nation BeLL tab](nation.md). If you get your survey in this step, please don't fill it out or submit it before completing Step 8.

###Step #8: Create Issues and Pull Requests:
Please create three issues, add comments to three issues, and resolve three issues by making the necessary changes in your repo. You will follow the same steps as [GitHub Issues](githubissues.md) but will be working to improve this Markdown Wiki so that it is clearer and better for future use. As you have now followed along with the Markdown Wiki thus far, you should all try to improve clarity and explanations for these steps. Learn by teaching- or editing our teaching tool in this case! When you are fixing an issue, please mention the number of the issue you are fixing in the description of your pull request.

###Step #9: Submit Survey:
Let us know in the Gitter chat when you're done and so that we can send the survey/publications to your community. Then, fill out the survey and submit it.
