# First Steps

As you begin these steps take note of any issues that you find as you will be solving them later on.

###Step #1: BeLL Installation:
1. Go to [this GitHub address](https://github.com/dogi/ole--vagrant-bells) to read through the basic instructions on how to create your own digital library (what we call the BeLL, or Basic e-Learning Library). It involves several steps of downloading various content to your OS so that you can use and work within our software. You should be able to scroll down to see ole--vagrant-bells, but you can also find it in the README.md file. Please do not make ANY changes to the text or files: simply read and follow the directions.
2. Please send Emily your resume again (along with a short description of yourself and what you would like to be called) to vi@ole.org. 
3. We use Crowdin to translate our user interface in many different languages. Please go to [this Crowdin link](https://crowdin.com/project/open-learning-exchange/invite) to join Crowdin by creating an account. If you speak an additional language, it would be very helpful for you to translate some of the words and familiarize yourself with the software.

###Step #2: Markdown and Fork Tutorial:
1. Follow the instructions on the [GitHub and Markdown page](githubandmarkdown.md) and comment on the [gitter.im chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat) when you have completed these steps.
2. Review [Vagrant instructions](vagrant.md) to ensure that you have completed last week's assignment fully. 
3. Follow the instructions under the [BeLL-Apps tab](bellapps.md). 

###Step #3: GitHub Issues Tutorial:
1. Complete the tutorial under the [GitHub Issues tab](githubissues.md) and be sure to keep us posted in the Gitter chat.
2. Please post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as personal practice. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. Following, do and create pull requests. Don't forget you can also comment and work on issues that you didn't create. Please pay attention that when you clone the html application you cannot run it locally (on your computer). 
3. Spend this time getting comfortable with GitHub. The more you work and commit and push, the better your GitHub profile is. This is very important to potential employers so we encourage you to spend time to increase your numbers so that your profile is strengthened.
4. Watch [Open Learning Exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io) and Follow [Emily](https://github.com/EmilyLarkin), [Stuart](https://github.com/sente) and [Dogi](https://github.com/dogi) on GitHub. In GitHub we "Watch" organizations and "Follow" individuals.  When you are on a repository or profile page, look for these buttons in the top right of the screen. Please also follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.

###Steps #4: Keeping Fork Updated:
1. Follow the directions for keeping your username.github.io and your local repository up to date on [Git Repositories](gitandrepositories.md).
2. Create another issue, comment on the issue, and then resolve the issue and make the necessary changes to your username.github.io again. You will follow the same steps as last week's [GitHub Issues](githubissues.md) but will be working to improve this Markdown Wiki so that it is clearer and better for future use. As you have now followed along with the Markdown Wiki thus far, you should all try to improve clarity and explanations for these steps. Learn by teaching- or editing our teaching tool in this case! Please create at least two to three issues and be sure to create pull requests once you have resolved them. If you are not already following [Dogi](https://github.com/dogi) and [Emily](https://github.com/EmilyLarkin), and watching [Open Learning Exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io) on GitHub, it is now imperative that you do so.
3. Please continue to work on translating on Crowdin. Get to at least 10% on a language that you speak. If you don't speak an additional language, ask Emily how to help on the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/chat). If you want to spend additional time, feel free to provide translations to 100%.

###Step #5: Nation BeLL:
1. Follow the directions under the [Nation BeLL tab](nation.md). 
2. Please create three issues, add comments to three issues, and resolve three issues. Also, please include pull requests in your issue activity. This week, your issues should focus on ways to improve my directions to make them clearer. I gave you some stones to cross the river but we're trying to build the bridge. 
3. Let us know in the Gitter chat when you're done and so that we can send you the survey/publications to your nation.
