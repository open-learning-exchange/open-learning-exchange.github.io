# Take Home Application

## Welcome to Take Home

The [Take Home Application]( https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/take-home) is an Android application using Java, CouchDB and JSON. The goal of the project is to mimic BeLL Apps on a mobile scale to allow users to use an Android device to interact with MyBeLL.

In here you will find step by step guides to getting the Take Home Application up and running in Android Studio. You will also learn how to build deployment environments to test your code. There are two places where you can try out your code: **Android Device Emulator** and **Real Android Device**. We prefer to test our code on real android device because it is the same environment as our end user. You can figure out how your app performs when there is no internet connection or other circumstances that Android Device Emulator is not supported (read more [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html)). Once you are setup, please read the [Take Home Documentation](takeHomeDocumentation.md) so you can understand the flow of the application.
