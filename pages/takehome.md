#Android "Take Home" Bell application development

##Project Setup
To be able to debug / repackage / build on the android mobile application, you need to:

- download and install the most recent official IDE for android: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) 

- Verify which version of the JDK you have: open a command line and type javac -version. If the JDK is not available or the version is lower than 1.8, download the [Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

> MAC Users : There are, however, known stability issues in Android Studio on Mac when using JDK 1.8. Until these issues are resolved, you can improve stability by downgrading your JDK to an older version (but no lower than JDK 1.6).

- Launch Android Studio after installation.

- Select whether you want to import previous Android Studio settings, then click OK.

---

The Android Studio Setup Wizard guides you through the rest of the setup, which includes downloading Android SDK components that are required for development. 
 We only need SDK 4.4 and above. You can install as many SDK’s packages as you wish to. Note that the packages are huge and therefore precaution must be taken with HDD available space in mind.

In a terminal / console of your choosing, navigate into the working directory of Android studio and git clone the “take-home“ repository at https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/take-home.git
Run Android studio. Select New from the file menu and select import project.
Navigate to Android studio -> take-home and select the settings.gradle file to import and open the project.
