I am originally from Swampscott, MA not too far from Cambridge. I am a computer science sophomore 
so most of my free time is spent doing homework or practicing my coding skills. However, when I am 
not doing that I love to be outside (walking, hiking, going to the beach) and I love trying new food
and restaurants around DC.
