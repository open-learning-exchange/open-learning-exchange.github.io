# Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is an open source tool to build development environments. We assume that you have followed the first instructions on [README.md](https://github.com/dogi/ole--vagrant-vi) to install Vagrant and VirtualBox on your OS. Below, you will find a shortened version on how to install this software quickly if needed as a reference.

## Prerequisites
Before installing Vagrant on any platform, it is necessary to check if VT-x/AMD-V instruction set is enabled on your processor. This is a requirement for installing vagrant on any platform since Vagrant is a type of virtualization software that utilizes VirtualBox. Most recent CPUs have this feature enabled already. If you are having trouble running vagrant, it may just be the case that VT-x/AMD-V is not enabled on your system.

If so, here are instructions to enable virtualization for [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/) | [Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/256792/how-do-i-enable-hardware-virtualization-technology-vt-x-for-use-in-virtualbox) | [Macintosh](http://kb.parallels.com/en/5653)

- Before installing vagrant, we recommend that you designate a new folder to your work at OLE. This is for a number of reasons, however this enables you to be organized and efficient in your work. If everything is in one place, it makes for a more convenient workflow.
- To do this, you can make a folder directly through the OS, or we will provide conventional terminal commands below.
- Open your `Terminal`(MacOSX), `cmd`(Windows), or `shell`(Linux). The commands should be identical on all three operating systems.


 1.    ``cd Desktop``
 2.    ``mkdir OLE``




## Windows

Vagrant only works if you are in the correct directory, which is a directory that includes a file called Vagrantfile. In our case, the directory is ole--vagrant-vi.  Here, three options are provided for you to operate Vagrant.

**1. Command Prompt**

Sometimes there are two kinds of Command Prompt listed in your system. One is **Command Prompt**, and the other is **Command Prompt(Admin)**. As is shown below:

![admin command](uploads/images/admin command.png)

Basically, they are the same, the only difference is the default path. For **Command Prompt(Admin)**, the default path is `C:\Windows\system32` and **Command Prompt** is `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME`.  You can use either **Command Prompt** or **Command Prompt(Admin)** to access the right directory for Vagrant.

**2. Windows PowerShell**

Windows PowerShell is a default shell interface installed in your machine. When you open it, the default path is `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME`.

**3. Git Bash**

Actually, **Git Bash** is also a good choice.  As you open **Git Bash**, you will find the default path of it is also `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME`.

As is mentioned above, the correct directory of Vagrant is `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\ole--vagrant-vi`. So as long as you are at the correct directory, you can use any of those three options to run commands related to Vagrant. Among those three options we suggest mostly using `Git Bash`,  which is already installed with the ole--vagrant-vi script. In Git Bash, you use the same commands as those you would use in Powershell. Some basic commands of Vagrant are as shown below.

First of all, make sure you are on the path `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME`. Then if you type `cd ole--vagrant-vi` followed by `vagrant global-status`, you will see a screen similar to this,

```
id       name   provider   state   directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
219abaa  vi     virtualbox running /Users/aberdean/ole--vagrant-vi

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```

What this screen tells you is that you have a Vagrant virtual machine called `vi` running on VirtualBox. It also tells you the directory in which your Vagrantfile for that machine is located.

As you can see, in our case, the state of our machine is `running`. However, you can suspend your virtual machine issuing the command `vagrant suspend` or you can stop it completely with `vagrant halt`. In both cases, if you want to restart your machine, you will need to issue the command `vagrant up`.

When you issue the command `vagrant suspend`, your machine state will become `saved`, and after issuing `vagrant up` the machine will restart exactly from the point is was at when you suspended it. On the other hand, when you issue the command `vagrant halt`, the state will become `poweroff`, and after issuing `vagrant up` the machine will restart from the initial state it was at when you first installed it.

Another command that may be sometimes useful is `vagrant destroy`, which allows you to delete your virtual machine. In this case, you will have to rebuild a new machine from scratch, if you ever need to use the machine again.

You may want to try and issue the above commands on your system, to get familiar with Vagrant, since that will prove useful later on, during your internship.

## Ubuntu
```
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox
    sudo apt-get install vagrant
```

## MacOS(X)
- Open your `Terminal`. We assume that [brew](http://brew.sh/) is already installed.
> The first step is locating to the local folder you have designated to do your work in. If you have a different locaiton than the one you see in the first step, replace the "OLE" with the directory to your folder. 

```
    cd OLE
    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew cask install vagrant
    brew cask install virtualbox
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing a community BeLL on your OS, you will need to follow these instructions to use your community BeLL. Vagrant only works when you are in the same directory where your Vagrantfile is located. To make sure you are in the proper directory, open your `Terminal` and type `cd ole--vagrant-vi`.
Now that you are in the right directory, check the status of your Vagrant machine with `vagrant global-status`. You should have the following message:

```
id       name   provider   state   directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2198a3d  vi     virtualbox running /Users/Emily/ole--vagrant-vi

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```
If you have a different message, either your Vagrant machine is powered off, or you have multiple machines with the same name, or you are experiencing some other technical issue.

If your Vagrant machine is powered off, use `vagrant up` to turn it on. To shut down your machine, use `vagrant halt`. Both of these commands need to be issued within the right directory. To destroy your machine entirely, use `vagrant destroy`.

**NOTE**:Remember, by using `vagrant destroy`, you destroy the machine and will need to rebuild a community BeLL if you wish to use it at a later time.

In case you accidentally used vagrant destroy:
- Rebuild the community BeLL following step 4
- Make sure you use a slightly different username and code in configurations
- Resend the request on Gitter chat

We suggest doing some light googling to find out more about the background and commands of vagrant. Use `vagrant --help` for other commands that you may need. See `vagrant --help` below:

```
Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]

    -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.
    -h, --help                       Print this help.

Additional subcommands are available, but are either more advanced
or not commonly used. To see all subcommands, run the command
`vagrant list-commands`.
```

## Troubleshooting
1. When typing the command "vagrant up" in OSX, you may experience an error such as the following: "vi: Box 'ole/jessie64' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...". A simple solution is to perform the command below. ```sudo rm /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/curl``` This will remove the old version of curl and vagrant should now work as usual.

2. When trying to access http://127.0.0.1:5985/apps/_design/bell/MyApp/index.html in step 4, you may experience an error such as the following: "no_db_found". A simple solution will be using ```vagrant destroy``` to delete the current machine, then try ```vagrant up``` to rebuild it.
