# Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is an open source tool to build development environments. In the previous step, you followed the first instructions on [README.md](https://github.com/dogi/ole--vagrant-vi) to install a BeLL virtual machine on your system. You may have noticed that one of the programs listed as dependencies was Vagrant.

We use Vagrant to power up our BeLL virtual machine. While this is done automatically (behind the scenes, as it were), it is useful for you to understand how to use Vagrant, because during your internship you may have to use it manually.

## Windows
First of all, Vagrant only works if you are in the correct directory, which is a directory that includes a file called Vagrantfile. In our case, the directory is ole--vagrant-vi. So, if you open up a Command Prompt on your machine and you type `cd ole--vagrant-vi` followed by `vagrant global-status`, you will see a screen similar to this,

```
id       name   provider   state   directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
219abaa  vi     virtualbox running /Users/aberdean/ole--vagrant-vi

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```

What this screen tells you is that you have a Vagrant virtual machine called `vi` running on VirtualBox. It also tells you the directory in which your Vagrantfile for that machine is located.

As you can see, in our case, the state of our machine is `running`. However, you can suspend your virtual machine issuing the command `vagrant suspend` or you can stop it completely with `vagrant halt`. In both cases, if you want to restart your machine, you will need to issue the command `vagrant up`.

When you issue the command `vagrant suspend`, your machine state will become `saved`, and after issuing `vagrant up` the machine will restart exactly from the point is was at when you suspended it. On the other hand, when you issue the command `vagrant halt`, the state will become `poweroff`, and after issuing `vagrant up` the machine will restart from the initial state it was at when you first installed it.

Another command that may be sometimes useful is `vagrant destroy`, which allows you to delete your virtual machine. In this case, you will have to rebuild a new machine from scratch, if you ever need to use the machine again.

You may want to try and issue the above commands on your system, to get familiar with Vagrant, since that will prove useful later on, during your internship.

You can also use `vagrant --help` to find out other possible commands you can issue on Vagrant. You will get a screen similar to this,

```
Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]

    -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.
    -h, --help                       Print this help.

Common commands:
     box             manages boxes: installation, removal, etc.
     connect         connect to a remotely shared Vagrant environment
     destroy         stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine
     global-status   outputs status Vagrant environments for this user
     halt            stops the vagrant machine
     help            shows the help for a subcommand
     init            initializes a new Vagrant environment by creating a Vagrantfile
     login           log in to HashiCorp's Atlas
     package         packages a running vagrant environment into a box
     plugin          manages plugins: install, uninstall, update, etc.
     port            displays information about guest port mappings
     powershell      connects to machine via powershell remoting
     provision       provisions the vagrant machine
     push            deploys code in this environment to a configured destination
     rdp             connects to machine via RDP
     reload          restarts vagrant machine, loads new Vagrantfile configuration
     resume          resume a suspended vagrant machine
     share           share your Vagrant environment with anyone in the world
     snapshot        manages snapshots: saving, restoring, etc.
     ssh             connects to machine via SSH
     ssh-config      outputs OpenSSH valid configuration to connect to the machine
     status          outputs status of the vagrant machine
     suspend         suspends the machine
     up              starts and provisions the vagrant environment
     version         prints current and latest Vagrant version

For help on any individual command run `vagrant COMMAND -h`

Additional subcommands are available, but are either more advanced
or not commonly used. To see all subcommands, run the command
`vagrant list-commands`.
