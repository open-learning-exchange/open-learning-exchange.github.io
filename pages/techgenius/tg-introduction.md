# Tech Genius Support

Welcome to the Tech Genius support section. You are here because you have completed the [First Steps](#!./pages/vi/vi-first-steps.md) and you are ready to deploy and support a Community, a group of communities, and/or nation server.

## The Big Picture

Planet Learning is a virtual library and student management portal that is deployed internationally to support content and opportunity distribution.

As Tech Geniuses you have demonstrated the ability to use the needed tools and procedures for deployment. As a means of communication, we encourage you to subscribe to notifications in [Tech Genius Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/techgenius) once you are invited to the channel. If you do not have access to the "techgenius" channel, please reach out to us directly!
