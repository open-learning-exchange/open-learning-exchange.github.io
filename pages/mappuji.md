### Short Bio

I design and write various computer programs mainly for analytics, back-end, and IoT device such as how to calculate the current position of a rocket from a signal from some radio-frequency detectors, a web app, or how to make a collection of computers run together efficiently in a cluster. I also help people increase their knowledge of technology by providing training, leading discussions, and working as a Teaching Assistant. Currently, I am focused on learning about and becoming involved in data science, machine learning, and artificial Intelligence.

I am proficient with various programming languages used in the software industry, including HTML, CSS, Python, R, C & C++, C#, SQL, and Bash. Python is my main language. I write code collaboratively with version control, such as Git. My engineering and physics background mean it is easy for me to understand new and future technologies like sensors, I/O in wearable devices, nanotechnology. I am a self-motivated learner who loves to learn new things, especially in the field of technology.

In the mobile-first and cloud-first era, I have a good deal of interest in high tech IT issues, including today’s Big Data and Internet of Things. I aspire to become a leader in the field of big data analytics, machine learning, and AI. Aside from that, I love having discussions with people to enrich my knowledge as well as my network, so feel free to reach out!
