I am a master student major in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My undergraduate major is software engineering, so I'm skilled at full product development lifecycle including design, development, and testing. I did several group projects before, such as a management system using Java, Spring MVC, a static site generator using Golang, HTML5, jQuery. I'm taking big data course this term and learning Hadoop, Spark and NoSQL.

Here's my skills:

- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- MongoDB

I'm a team player, and I'm excited to joining you guys!
