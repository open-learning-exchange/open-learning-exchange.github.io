# Android Device Setup

Follow these steps to install and run the **Take Home** application on an Android device:
 
## Part 1: Setting up your Device

* __Go to the 'Build number' section.__

Hereâ€™s how to get there on a few popular devices:

Stock Android: Settings > About phone > Build number

Samsung Galaxy S5: Settings > About device > Build number

LG G3: Settings > About phone > Software information > Build number

HTC One (M8): Settings > About > Software information > More > Build number

* __Tap on the 'Build number' section 7 times.__

A message 'You are now a Developer!' will flash on your screen.

* __Go back to Settings main page.__

You can now see a new 'Developer options' section.

* __Go to 'Developer options' and check 'USB Debugging'.__

Select `OK` on the 'Allow USB debugging' pop-up.

* __Connect your device to the computer running Android Studio with USB to microUSB/Type C cable.__

You would see a 'USB debugging connected' notification.

## Part 2: Install and run Take Home on your device

* __Go to menu bar and select 'Run app' from 'Run' drop-down menu in Android Studio.__

A list of connected and virtual devices will pop up.

* __Select `OK` on the Allow USB debugging pop-up on your device screen.__

You can check 'Always allow from this computer' to avoid doing it everytime, before selecting `OK`. Now, your device name would appear on the above pop-op on Android Studio.

* __Click on your device name and click `OK`.__

The app would be installed on your phone as 'Planet' or 'Take Home'. This might take several minutes. In case there is another pop-op, select OK or install as appropriate.

Note: Configure and log into the app, just like you would do on an [Emulator](http://open-learning-exchange.github.io/#!./pages/takeHomeEmulatorSetup.md#Logging_in_on_Android_Emulator)
