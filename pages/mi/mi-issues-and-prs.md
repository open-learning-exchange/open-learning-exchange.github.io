# Step 8 - Create More Issues and Pull Requests

In this step, your goal is to create, comment on, and resolve GitHub issues to improve our Markdown Wiki. Here's what you'll need to do:

1. **Create Issues**:
  - Create 3 new issues in our GitHub repository regarding Mobile Intern First Steps' content or myPlanet User Manual.
  - Each issue should focus on a specific problem or improvement.
    - Ensure that **at least one issue** addresses content reduction, such as dead links, repetitive content, excessive detail, or the potential to reference external official documentation in Mobile Intern First Steps.
    - Ensure that **at least one issue** focuses on populating or improving the [myPlanet User Manual](#!pages/manual/myplanet/overview.md) page. While the features may differ slightly, use the more completed [Planet User Manual](#!pages/manual/planet/overview.md) as a reference for text style and structure.

2. **Comment on Issues**: Provide helpful comments on at least 3 existing issues that you did not create. This could be to provide feedback, suggest solutions, ask questions, or clarify the issue.

3. **Resolve Issues with Pull Requests**: Resolve the 3 issues by making the necessary changes in separate branches derived from `master` in your repository, and submit a distinct pull request for each one.

Follow the **same process** as described in the [GitHub Issues step](mi-github-issues.md), working to improve our documentation for future interns. To get your pull requests merged, they must be approved by at least two other OLE team members/interns. After creating a pull request, announce it on the Discord chat to request reviews. You may need to make additional corrections based on feedback.

Remember, even small issues are worth addressing. Keep your issues focused and concise. If your pull requests need additional approvals, continue to work on other tasks while you wait.

Just as your learning with this Wiki was made possible by the efforts of previous interns, now we turn to you to continue that tradition and help future interns take their First Steps. Help us make this documentation clear and useful for those who follow.

**NOTE**: While adding details can be helpful, it's important to remember that less is often more. Over time, this First Steps guide has become bloated with too much information, making it harder to follow. As you work on improving this guide, focus on simplifying the instructions and removing any unnecessary content. The goal is to create a clear and concise guide that future virtual interns can easily understand and use.

**NOTE**: While waiting for two OLE team members to approve your Pull Requests, you can continue creating more Issues and Pull Requests (upon approval, we suggest). They will all count towards your final Issue/PR total. PR approval can take time, so don't let a lengthy approval/fix process stop you from progressing in your "First Steps".

Once you complete Step 8 you will have:

- 5 merged pull requests (one at step 1, one at step 6 and three at step 8)
- 4 comments made on issues you didn't create (one at step 6 and three at step 8)
- 4 issues created (one at step 6 and three at step 8)

**HINT**: You can track your progress with the number of pull requests and issues [here](../track-first-steps-progress.md).
