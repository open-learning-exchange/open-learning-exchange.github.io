> After Forking

**Open Android Studio:**
 Launch Android Studio on your computer. If this is your first time using Android Studio, it may take a moment to set up the initial configuration.

**Import the Project:**
 In Android Studio, click on "Open an existing Android Studio project" or navigate to "File" > "Open" and select the cloned repository folder that contains the Android app project. Click "OK" to import the project.

**Gradle Build:**
 After importing the project, Android Studio will perform a Gradle build, which may take a few moments. Gradle is the build system for Android projects, and it will download any necessary dependencies for the project.

**Configure Emulator or Connect Device:**
 To run the app, you need to set up either an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device to your computer:
    - Emulator: In Android Studio, you can create a virtual device emulator by navigating to "Tools" > "AVD Manager." Follow the prompts to create a new virtual device based on your preferred device configuration.
    - Physical Device: If you want to run the app on a physical Android device, connect it to your computer using a USB cable and ensure that USB debugging is enabled in the device's developer options.

**Select Run Configuration:**
 In Android Studio's toolbar, select the desired run configuration from the drop-down menu. It should be the name of your app module.

**Run the App:**
 Click on the "Run" button (typically a green play button) or use the keyboard shortcut "Shift + F10" (Windows) or "Control + R" (Mac) to run the app. Android Studio will deploy the app to the emulator or connected device.

**App Launch:**
 Once the app is installed on the emulator or device, it will automatically launch. You can interact with the app and test its functionality.

## Step 4 - Connect myPlanet to planet vi

- In this step you will be connecting your application, myPlanet, to another application called planet vi. This connection will allow you to share data and resources between the two applications. To establish the connection, follow the instructions below:
- Begin by locating the settings icon within the myPlanet application. This icon is typically represented by a gear or cogwheel symbol. Click on the settings icon to initiate a pop-up dialog box.

- After entering the IP address and password, click on the "Sync" button. This action will initiate the synchronization process between myPlanet and planet vi. It will establish a connection between the two applications, enabling data exchange and collaboration.

## Step 6 - 1 issue and pull request

* Follow the tutorial under the [GitHub Issues tab](../vi/vi-github-issues.md) to create at least one issue. Post a link in the discord channel whenever you create an issue or when you comment on someone else's issue. You are encouraged to post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as for personal practice.
* No issue is too big or too small to be filed and it is OK if you are not sure how to fix it yourself. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. It is ok to file an issue about minor typos and very small changes, but do not make this the case for all of the issues that you file.
* You can also work on issues that you didn't create. Make sure you have created at least one issue, resolved it, commented on an issue you didn't create and have a pull request with the fix merged.

## Step 7 - course about

* Explore Available Courses:navigate to the "courses" tab or directory. This directory should contain a list of available courses.
* Choose a Course: Browse through the courses and select the one you are interested in. Each course may have its own subdirectory containing course materials and resources.
* Join the Course: Access the chosen course's subdirectory and explore the course materials, including any text files, presentations, code samples, or exercises provided. Take note of the structure and organization of the course.
* Go Through the Course: Begin by reading the course introduction or overview, which may provide information on the course objectives, prerequisites, and recommended study plan. Follow the course materials in the order specified, taking your time to understand and absorb the content.
* Engage with Course Materials: Engage with the course materials actively. This may involve reading text files, viewing presentations, playing audios and videos.
* Take Notes and Rate the course: As you progress through the course, take notes of any issue you encounter and open an issue in the github repository and rate the course you have just completed
* Collaborate and Seek Help: Seek help if you encounter difficulties or have questions related to the course content.

## Step 8 - 3 issue and pull request

* You may continue making Issues, Pull requests and Comments, or move on to the next step, while you are waiting for your pull request to be merged. The approval process for your Step 6 fix may take time, but it is OK to continue working.
  Once you complete Step 6 you will have:

> 2 pull requests made (one at step 3 and one at step 6)
> 1 comment added (on an issue you didn't create)
> 1 issue created

## Step 9 - Pull request for adding yourself to team and read pre interview document

* Once you have finished step 8, sync your community with the nation (as you did in Step 7 - [Nation Planet tab](../vi/vi-nation.md)).

Next thing is to add yourself to the virtual intern list found in [vi-team.md](../vi/vi-team.md) and create a pull request. Message us ("@/all" and "@dogi") in the Gitter chat room so that we can set up a meeting and add you to the team as soon as possible.
Make sure to read through the [intern orientation document](../robots/rbts-intern-orientation.md) before the meeting.
