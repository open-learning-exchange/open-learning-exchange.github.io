# First Steps

## The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming an OLE Virtual Mobile Intern! We treat these first steps as a vetting process to prove that you can follow basic instructions before moving on to more complex projects and larger teams. Think of this as the interview for the internship.

If you are selected for the internship after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the OLE mobile interns team! We’ll add you to our Virtual Interns Discord channel and assign you to a specific team to work on developing and improving OLE’s software. Our current mobile projects are:

1. **[myPlanet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/myplanet)**: An Android app that syncs with Planet to save data for offline use and send usage data.
2. **[Remote](https://github.com/treehouses/remote)**: An Android app that communicates with headless Raspberry Pi mobile server running treehouses image via Bluetooth.

If you are selected after completing these steps, you'll work with your team on an assignment, and assignments will change weekly. During this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with various software and languages including **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**, **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)**, **[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)**, **[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)**, **[Command Line/Terminal](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp)**, **[Command Line/Terminal Scripts](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)**, **[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)**, **[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)**, **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**, **[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)**, **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)**, **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**, **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**, **[Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm)**, and **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**.

**NOTE**: This is an unpaid, intensive internship requiring at least 20 hours of work per week. You can find more information about the internship in our [FAQ](mi-faq.md#General_Internship_Questions). If you have additional questions, feel free to ask in the Discord server!

## The Steps

Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and the Open Learning Exchange (OLE) is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown, Vagrant, Docker, Git, GitHub, GitHub issues, GitHub pull requests, etc. You'll also be introduced to OLE's digital library, [Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet), and its companion Android app, [myPlanet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/myplanet).

These steps may seem simple, but we expect high-quality work, which might require extra time. We want to see that you can use, or learn to use, these tools effectively — including writing clear GitHub issues, creating proper pull requests, navigating Planet, using Vagrant and Docker, etc. Just passively following the steps is the bare minimum; instead, aim to impress us with excellent GitHub etiquette and well-structured Markdown.

Take the opportunity to read more about the tools and languages we use to deepen your understanding and reduce confusion. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!** The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice in first steps are crucial for both this internship and a future career in software development.

The MDwiki offers plenty of resources to help you complete these steps. You'll find a list of useful links at the end of each step. We also have an [FAQ page](mi-faq.md) with answers to commonly asked questions. This page also includes more [helpful links and video tutorials](mi-faq.md#Helpful_Links) to help you become familiar with the tools and languages we use. If you can't find what you need on the FAQ page, Google and Stack Exchange are great additional resources. :)

**We also would like you to keep us regularly updated in the Discord channel as you complete these steps. We will ask you to send messages, links, and screenshots along the way, which we'll use to track your progress. Please make sure not to miss this, as it's crucial for us to track your work.**

A significant part of these steps is identifying problems or suggesting improvements for this MDwiki. As you complete the steps, take note of any issues you encounter or ideas for enhancements. This helps improve the MDwiki and these steps for future interns.

While there's no official deadline for completing these steps, most successful candidates finish them within 7-8 days. Good luck!

## Step 0 - Prerequisites

To participate in the internship, you will need the following hardware:

1. A laptop or desktop computer with at least 8GB of RAM.
2. An Android device (phone or tablet) with a minimum of 3GB of RAM and running Android 9 "Pie" or later. Google Chromebooks works as well
3. A stable internet connection.

## Step 1 - Markdown & Forking Workflow

Follow the instructions on [Creating Your GitHub Profile Page: A Guide to Markdown & Forking Workflow](mi-github-and-markdown.md).

## Step 2 - Get myPlanet App

myPlanet is an Android app available on the Play Store. Please find and install it there using [this link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ole.planet.myplanet).

## Step 3 - Build myPlanet in Android Studio

Follow the guide at [myPlanet and Android Studio](mi-myplanet-and-android-studio.md) to clone myPlanet repository from GitHub and build the myPlanet app with Android Studio.

## Step 4 - Connect myPlanet app to Planet

Follow the guide at [Connecting myPlanet to Planet](mi-step4.md).

## Step 5 - Take a Course on myPlanet

Follow the guide at [myPlanet Course](mi-myplanet-course.md).

## Step 6 - GitHub Issues Tutorial

* Follow the tutorial under the [GitHub Issues](mi-github-issues.md) to create at least one issue. Post a link in the discord channel whenever you create an issue or when you comment on someone else's issue. You are encouraged to post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as for personal practice.
* No issue is too big or too small to be filed and it is OK if you are not sure how to fix it yourself. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. It is ok to file an issue about minor typos and very small changes, but do not make this the case for all of the issues that you file.
* You can also work on issues that you didn't create. Make sure you have created at least one issue, resolved it, commented on an issue you didn't create and have a pull request with the fix merged.

**NOTE**: You can track your progress with the number of pull requests and issues [here](../track-first-steps-progress.md).

## Step 7 - Course About

* Explore Available Courses:navigate to the "courses" tab or directory. This directory should contain a list of available courses.
* Choose a Course: Browse through the courses and select the one you are interested in. Each course may have its own subdirectory containing course materials and resources.
* Join the Course: Access the chosen course's subdirectory and explore the course materials, including any text files, presentations, code samples, or exercises provided. Take note of the structure and organization of the course.
* Go Through the Course: Begin by reading the course introduction or overview, which may provide information on the course objectives, prerequisites, and recommended study plan. Follow the course materials in the order specified, taking your time to understand and absorb the content.
* Engage with Course Materials: Engage with the course materials actively. This may involve reading text files, viewing presentations, playing audios and videos.
* Take Notes and Rate the course: As you progress through the course, take notes of any issue you encounter and open an issue in the github repository and rate the course you have just completed
* Collaborate and Seek Help: Seek help if you encounter difficulties or have questions related to the course content.
* Be sure to capture screenshots of your exploration and send them to the discord channel. Be sure to tag @okurole_25668 and @dogi in your message.

## Step 8 - Create Issues and Pull Requests

Create 3 more issues, add comments to 3 other issues, and resolve 3 issues by making the necessary changes in your repo with 3 separate pull requests. You should resolve 3 issues created by yourself, and make sure to mention in the issue that you are working on it. Be sure to seek confirmation from the OLE team before starting work on your issues. You will follow the same steps as in [GitHub Issues tab](mi-github-issues.md), continuing to improve this Markdown Wiki so that it is educational, yet easy to understand for future interns.

Just as your learning with this Wiki was made possible by the efforts of previous interns, now we turn to you to continue that tradition and help future interns take their First Steps. Through this step, you should try to further improve our Markdown Wiki, with better explanations, formatting fixes, and more! You must have made your pull requests and have them each approved by at least two other OLE team members/interns in order for it to be merged to the upstream repository. Just as before, announce your Pull Request on the Discord chat so other members can review it. You may need to make some additional corrections. Learn by teaching - or editing our teaching tool, in this case!

 Remember, no issue is too small to address! Make sure that your issue is concise, and focuses on addressing a single theme at a time .The approval process for this step may take time, but it is OK to continue working.

 **An example area you can make a meaningful is in improving the [myPlanet manual](../manual/myplanet/overview.md)**

**NOTE**: When you are fixing an issue, mention the issue number you are fixing in the title of your pull request and make a new branch for every new issue from the master branch.
  
Once you complete Step 8 you will have:

> 5 pull requests made (one at step 3 and one at step 6)
> 4 comments added (on an issue you didn't create)
> 4 issues created

**NOTE**: You can track your progress with the number of pull requests and issues [here](../track-first-steps-progress.md).

## Step 9 - Be part of the team

* Once you have finished step 8, sync your community with the nation (as you did in Step 7 - [Nation Planet tab](mi-nation.md)).

  Next thing is to add yourself to the virtual intern list found in [mi-team.md](mi-team.md) and create a pull request. Message us ("@okurole_25668", "@dogi" and "@vi-mobile") in the Discord channel so that we can set up a meeting and add you to the team as soon as possible.
  Make sure to read through the [intern orientation document](mi-intern-orientation.md) before the meeting.
