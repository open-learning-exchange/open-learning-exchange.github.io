## 🔥 About Me

Hey there! I’m **Saksham**, a **Computer Science Master's graduate** from George Mason University and a **former Software Engineer at Samsung Research**.

I’m passionate about building things that *just work* — clean, scalable, and designed with intention. I bring 3+ years of experience shipping production-ready apps and solving real-world problems with thoughtful engineering.

When I’m not coding, I’m either working out, meal-prepping, or doing side projects for fun and learning.
