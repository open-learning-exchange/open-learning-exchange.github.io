# **Description:**
> Hello, I'm Noah Kim, a junior in computer engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. 
> I've delved into exciting projects, such as crafting the UX UI design for the Events Page in the React Native app 'PotLuck,' earning positive reviews from beta testers. 
> Additionally, I engineered a remote light switch system, in which I utilized the arduino uno board microcontroller and servo motor and implemented a code that would wirelessly turn the light switch on and off using a remote.
> Beyond my technical expertise, I'm deeply engaged on campus. From the president of the tennis club, I lead executive board meetings, host weekly sessions, and mentor new players, to starting a professional development club called the Society of Asian Scientist Engineers as the External Vice President.
> I'm eager to bring my innovative mindset and leadership experience to a dynamic internship or co-op opportunity for the summer and fall of 2024. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your team's success.
