> ## Introduction

* Hi, my name is Soumik Mitra. I am a recent graduate of the University of South Carolina Aiken with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Computer Science. During the final year of my bachelor's degree, I developed an Android app as part of my capstone project. The app focuses on displaying PDF files to users on the topic of discrete mathematics. To enhance this app, I am currently developing a web-based application using React, TypeScript, and Vite as the bundler. This app features a search bar, bookmarking, last-page-read functionality, and PWA support. I am also in the process of integrating a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat model. Additionally, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from the same university.
