### About Me

My name is Elijah Whang, and I am currently a rising junior studying computer science at Brown University! I've been fortunate to gain hands-on experience through various internships and research projects, such as developing AI recommendation models at a startup and exploring natural language processing at Brownâ€™s LUNAR Lab. I also co-founded Co-Crit, a mobile app that reviews businesses' coronavirus safety measures, which received significant user traction and media coverage.

Outside of work, I'm a **huge** foodie and basketball enthusiast. I love trying out different cuisines, with Korean beef shortrib being my favorite dish (picture shown below). I also play basketball almost every morning and am a dedicated San Antonio Spurs fan.

Nice to meet you!
