# Step 3 - myPlanet and Android Studio

Follow [Cloning a repository - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to clone [OLE's myPlanet repository](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/myplanet) onto your local machine.

## 1. Download and Open Android Studio

- Go to [Install Android Studio | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and follow the steps to install Android Studio.
- Launch Android Studio on your computer. If this is your first time using Android Studio, it may take a moment to set up the initial configuration.

## 2. Import the Project

 In Android Studio welcome dialog, click on "Open" to open an existing Android Studio project or navigate to "File" > "Open..." and select the cloned repository folder that contains the myPlanet app project. Click "OK" to import the project.

## 3. Gradle Build

 After importing the project, Android Studio will perform a Gradle build, which may take a few moments. Gradle is the build system for Android projects, and it will download any necessary dependencies for the project.

## 4. Configure Emulator or Connect Device

 To run the app, you need to set up either an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device to your computer:
    - Emulator: go to "Tools" > "Device Manager." Follow the prompts or use the + icon to create a new virtual tablet device.
    - Physical Device: If you want to run the app on a physical Android device, connect it to your computer using a USB cable and ensure that USB debugging is enabled in the device's developer options.

## 5. Select Run Configuration

 In Android Studio's toolbar, select the desired run configuration from the drop-down menu. It should `app` in our case.

## 6. Run the App

 Click on the "Run" button (typically a green play button) right next to it or use the keyboard shortcut "Shift + F10" (Windows) or "Control + R" (Mac) to run the app. Android Studio will install the app to the emulator or connected device.

## 7. App Launch

 After installing the app on your emulator or device, it will launch automatically. Grant any permissions the app requests to proceed. Once the app is running, take a screenshot of it on your emulator or phone and share it with us in the Discord channel.
