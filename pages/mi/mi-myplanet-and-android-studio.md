# Step 3 - myPlanet and Android Studio

## Preparation

Follow [Cloning a repository - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to clone [OLE's myPlanet repository](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/myplanet) onto your local machine.

## 1. Download and Open Android Studio

- Go to [Install Android Studio | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and follow the steps to install Android Studio.
- Launch Android Studio on your computer. If this is your first time using Android Studio, it may take a moment to set up the initial configuration.

## 2. Open the Project

 - On the welcome screen, click the "Open" button. Alternatively, if you have a project already open, you can navigate to "File" > "Open..." from the top menu bar.
 - A file dialog box will appear. Navigate to the location where your project's repository folder is located.

## 3. Gradle Build

 After importing the project, Android Studio will perform a Gradle build, which may take a few moments. Gradle is the build system for Android projects, and it will download any necessary dependencies for the project.

## 4. Configure Emulator or Connect Device

 To run the app, you need to set up either an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device to your computer:
   - Emulator: Open "Tools" > "Device Manager." Click the + icon to create a new virtual device, then follow the prompts.
   - Physical Device: Connect your Android device to your computer with a USB cable. Make sure USB debugging is enabled in the developer options.

## 5. Select Run Configuration

 In Android Studio's toolbar, select the desired run configuration from the drop-down menu. It would be `app` in our case.

## 6. Run the App

Click the green "Run" button to install and launch the app on the emulator or connected device.

## 7. App Launch

After installing the app on your emulator or device, it will launch automatically. Approve any permission requests to continue. Once the app is running, take a screenshot from your emulator or phone and share it in the Discord channel to let us know you completed step 3.
