## Internship Hardware Requirements

To participate in this internship, you will need the following:

1. A laptop or desktop computer with a minimum of 8GB of RAM.
2. An Android device (phone or tablet) with a minimum of 3GB of RAM and running Android 9 "Pie" or later, and/or a Chromebook.

## Watch the Organization and Follow Contributors

In GitHub, we [follow organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-organizations) and [follow people](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-people) to receive notifications about their activity. Look for the "Watch" button at the top right of the page when you are in a repository. Additionally, follow each other to stay updated on what others in the group are working on.

- Use the "Watch" button in repositories you're working on and "Follow" individuals to keep up with the latest activities.
- Follow the [Open Learning Exchange
](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange) to stay updated on changes with OLE on GitHub.
- Watch the [Open Learning Exchange's myPlanet repository](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/myplanet) to stay updated on changes with the main repository you'll be working on.
- Follow OLE's CTO [dogi](https://github.com/dogi) and myPlanet's core developer [Gideon](https://github.com/Okuro3499) on GitHub.
- You can also follow [other active mobile interns](mi-team.md) to stay updated on their activities.
