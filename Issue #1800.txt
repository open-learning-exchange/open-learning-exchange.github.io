### Problem
When ever I search for any resources from the library and click on view details I am able to edit and make changes to the main resource file. I am not the owner or the edit but still I can make those changes. I am not sure if you want it to be editable for everyone but I think this should not be made editable for everyone because of security reasons. Anyone can make changes to anyone's resource. 


### Steps to reproduce the problem
Steps:
1. Login to your Bell MyApp using username and password.
2. Click on library 
3. From any of the available resources click on view details.
4. A new view details page is visible which lets me edit the resource details.

### Proposed solution
<!-- Write N/A if not applicable -->
1.Every resource should have authentication so that only the person authenticated should be able to edit it.
2. If I have not uploaded the resource or am not the admin then I should not be able to see the edit button and not be able to edit the resource details.
3. Proper authentication hierarchy is missing and needs to be implemented for security point of view.

(I am not sure if it is suppose to be like this but I think there should be some authentication before anyone can change the resource details),

Thank you.
