Hi! I have an A.S. in Computer Science and am currently working towards my B.S. Honors in Computer Science and Biology minor at the University of Maryland-College Park.  I am an affirmed geek(ette), a bibliophile, gymnast, and wanderluster. I also love 
learning and applying new languages, both programming languages (Perl, C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Java, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, 
Rails, PHP, and more) and natural languages (French, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Latin, some Italian, some Arabic, some German, and some Igbo).
