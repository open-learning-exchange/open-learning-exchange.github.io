####Greetings! I am a *Freshman* studying *Computer Science*. I've taken courses in Java, Python, SQL and Database design. In the past year or so I've also picked up some web design and have used HTML/CSS and Javascript. My primary computer is a PC and my laptop is a MacBook.
I'm passionate about:


* Technology in all it's forms
* Learning new things
* Teaching and improving my craft
* Social Equality

On occasion, I like to write about my learning / life experiences in my [blog](https://smittyanddrweston.wordpress.com/). I look forward to working with everyone and helping to bring education to people around the globe!
