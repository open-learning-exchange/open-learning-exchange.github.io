I am a **Junior** majoring in **Computer Science**, and I'm passionate about 
- technology, 
- education, 
- genetics,
- neuroscience,
- and tons of other stuff!!!

My favorite programming language is **Python**, and besides *Windows*, I also use *Mac* and *Linux*, in particular *Ubuntu*.  
I hope to get a ton of hands-on experience from this internship and to help furthering the democratization of education.  
I'm looking forward to work with all of you!
