Hi! I am a senior at Bridgewater State University studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I enjoy learning about
software engineering and my research has been in virtual reality using robotics and android app development. I also have a 
huge passion for traveling. I have studied abroad to Spain, Morocco, England, Canada, Hawaii, Portugal, and Belize. I hope 
to one day visit every continent.
