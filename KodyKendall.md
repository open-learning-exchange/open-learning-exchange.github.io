# About Me:

I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Utah. I've been coding and developing websites, applications, 
and other programs for roughly 1-2 years. I'm currently most familiar with: 

- Using Java in an Object-Oriented Fashion
- Using HTML and CSS, along with frameworks like Bootstrap and WordPress
- Operating in Eclipse/Android Studio
- Building and working on simple Android applications. 

Over the summer I'm planning on taking classes that will teach me: XHTML, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and C++. I hope to be able to
use the skills I learn over the summer to help Online Learning Exchange.
