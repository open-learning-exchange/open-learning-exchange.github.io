This is a modified version of MDwiki for the Open Learning Exchange based on the 0.6.x branch.

## Differences from main repo
* The flatly theme for Bootstrap is the main theme rather than the default, allowing the flatly theme to be used offline.  The default Bootstrap theme can be chosen in navigation.md with 'classic'
* Added a function to basic_skeleton.js which adds target="\_blank" to any links to external domains
* Adds a line to the setPageTitle function which will set the text of the title tag to the text of the opening h1 tag of the page if found.
* Adds OLE logo in upper left.
* Includes added styles for offline use of the Lato font.
* Changes favicon from a favicon.png to favicon.ico file in the base directory.
* Modifies script to prevent XSS so it only adds `./` to the front of links once.
* Highlight.js crashes when included inline, so it is included as a local reference in a script tag.  Requires `highlight-7.3.pack.min.js` file in an `extlib/js/` directory of the wiki.
* Sets width of the side navigation menu with css rather than javascript.
* Uses jQuery 3.2.0 and Colorbox 1.6.4
