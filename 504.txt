So I think it'll be a great idea to use gimp for a design task. I've used it for one of my courses this semester and it is 
very easy to learn. I forgot the name of the methods but they include creating a word art and having a background picture such as a waterfall inside that wordart. There were other things where I can drag that word art into another picture or have another picture fade. There was also an instance where I would click on several outlines of a particular object in a picture and I can blur the background so that object would stand out.
