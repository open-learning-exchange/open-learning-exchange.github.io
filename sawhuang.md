My name is **Sawyer Huang**, and I am a freshman at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) studying [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/).
I'm from a small town called Gardiner, NY, but I currently reside in Ithaca, NY as a full-time student.
When I'm not programming, you can probably find me at the gym lifting weights.

I am excited because I believe this internship is a great opportunity to gain exposure to modern professional coding practices.
I want to serve as a reliable team member on all endeavors throughout my time at OLE.
